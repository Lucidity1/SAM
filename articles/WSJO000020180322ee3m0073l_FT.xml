mathematician Freeman Dyson is an interesting man, and, at the age of 94, he no doubt has a fascinating story to tell about his long and productive life. This book, however, does not contain that story—at least, not all of it and not in the form that many of us would have wished. For one thing, it ends in 1978, 40 years ago, and Mr. Dyson has done a great deal since. For another, the book consists not of his recollections of his life, but rather largely of letters that he wrote to his parents between the ages of 17 and 54. In other words, it is not the long-awaited fleshing-out of the autobiographical vignettes in his quasi-memoir "Disturbing the Universe" (1979). Nor is it in any way a sequel. It is instead a kind of companion volume to that book, in a different key, with many of its people and events seen under a different light.</Para></LeadPara></HandL><TailParas fid="td"><Para>In the preface to "Disturbing the Universe," Mr. Dyson writes that "memory is unreliable. It not only selects and rearranges the facts of our lives, but also embroiders and invents." In the preface to "Maker of Patterns: An Autobiography Through Letters," he writes that, in contrast, "letters are valuable witnesses to history because they are written without hindsight." "When I compare my memories with the letters," he continues, "I see that I not only forget things, I also remember things that never happened." He offers a striking example of this concerning his memory of a lunch party given by Robert and Kitty Oppenheimer at their home in Princeton, the other guests at which were Reinhold Niebuhr and his wife, Ursula, and George Kennan and his wife, Annelise. After lunch, he says, "we sat around a glowing wood fire in the living room. Oppenheimer pulled a beautiful leather-bound volume from his bookcase and read a poem, 'The Pulley' by George Herbert (1633), in a beautifully cadenced voice." Recently, however, he came across a letter written by Ursula Niebuhr describing the occasion and discovered that every detail of his memory was correct except one: He had not been there!</Para><Para>Maker of Patterns</Para><Para>By Freeman Dyson</Para><Para>Liveright, 400 pages, $27.95</Para><Para>All of which supports the view that he was wise to ask his mother to keep the letters he had written to her, and to keep the letters that others had sent to him. But this does nothing to support his decision to present his autobiography as a collection of letters. Mr. Dyson recalls reading James Watson's book "The Double Helix" and being impressed by the vivid detail Watson brings to his account of the discovery of the structure of DNA, and the way he brings characters to life through verbatim accounts of their conversations. When he met Watson, he asked him how he could have possibly remembered those conversations in such detail. "Oh, that was easy," Watson replied, "I wrote a letter every week to my mother in America describing my life in England, and she kept the letters." It was that which prompted Mr. Dyson to ask his mother to preserve his end of their correspondence. But, would "The Double Helix" have been such a gripping read if it had consisted of Watson's letters home? No, its hold on the reader is achieved though the kind of pacing that can be achieved only with a narrative thread.</Para><Para>As for ending the book in 1978, Mr. Dyson justifies that by pointing out that "the second half of a life is usually less interesting than the first half." This is true, but, still, I, for one, would have been very interested to read Mr. Dyson's account of, for example, his involvement in the climate change debates of the last 40 years. I would also have liked to read about his early years, growing up as the son of the distinguished composer Sir George Dyson and his wife, Mildred, who trained as a solicitor but, after Freeman's birth, worked as a social worker. What he seems to have acquired from his parents is a wide range of intellectual and cultural interests and a left-leaning political outlook (he was, he has said, "brought up as a socialist"). Of that, we hear only tantalizingly little in "Disturbing the Universe," and in this book, nothing at all.</Para><Para>So much for what we don't have in "Maker of Patterns"; what about what we do have? The first letters are written from Trinity College, Cambridge, and concern the lectures he attended, the distinguished and elderly (it was 1941 and all the young lecturers had gone off to war) mathematicians he was taught by (including, most notably, G.H. Hardy and John Littlewood), and the trips he took to climb mountains in various parts of Britain with the university's mountaineering club. After two years at Cambridge, Mr. Dyson went to work as a civilian in the operational research section of the RAF Bomber Command. One gathers he is not proud of his wartime service. After the war, he had an opportunity to go to Germany to meet students there, and took it gratefully. ("I had killed enough Germans," he writes, "and I wanted to make peace with the survivors.")</Para><Para>The most interesting period of Mr. Dyson's life, and the most interesting part of this book, begins in 1947, when he left Cambridge to study for a doctorate (in physics rather than mathematics) at Cornell University with the great physicist Hans Bethe. Bethe had been one of the leading scientists at Los Alamos, as had three of his Cornell colleagues: Robert Wilson, Philip Morrison and Richard Feynman. A turning point, perhaps the turning point, in Mr. Dyson's life was the development of his friendship with Feynman, whom he describes to his parents as "the brightest of the young theoreticians here." In Mr. Dyson's letters, Feynman comes wonderfully to life. "Feynman is the young American professor," Mr. Dyson writes, "half genius and half buffoon, who keeps all physicists and their children amused with his effervescent vitality."</Para><Para>In the summer of 1948, Mr. Dyson took a road trip across the United States from Cornell to Albuquerque, N.M., with Feynman at the wheel. The conversations they had during the journey were decisive in shaping Mr. Dyson's career and his reputation. Feynman's greatest contribution to physics, the one for which he shared a Nobel Prize in 1965, was his formulation of quantum electrodynamics (QED), using his now famous "Feynman diagrams." Feynman presented this work to his fellow physicists at a conference in 1948, but it fell on deaf ears, the scientists present preferring the more austere formulations developed by his eventual Nobel co-winners, Julian Schwinger and, independently, the Japanese physicist Shin'ichirō Tomonaga. Mr. Dyson was one of the very few who appreciated the advantages of Feynman's version. After his road trip with Feynman, Mr. Dyson attended the summer school in theoretical physics at the University of Michigan, where he heard Schwinger expound his version of QED. Then, on the way to Princeton, where he had arranged to spend some time working at the Institute for Advanced Study with Robert Oppenheimer, Mr. Dyson had the breakthrough that led to his most celebrated work: a proof that Feynman's theory was formally equivalent to the theory of Schwinger and Tomonaga. Rather brilliantly, that moment is captured in one of his letters home:</Para><Para>On the third day of the journey a remarkable thing happened . . . I began to think very hard about physics, and particularly about the rival radiation theories of Schwinger and Feynman. Gradually my thoughts grew more coherent, and before I knew where I was, I had solved the problem that had been in the back of my mind all this year, which was to prove the equivalence of the two theories.</Para><Para>Mr. Dyson's time in Princeton was spent largely attempting to convince a skeptical Oppenheimer of the merits of Feynman's theory. It took a while, but when he succeeded he was rewarded with a lifetime's appointment at the Institute, in Oppenheimer's words, "for proving me wrong."</Para><Para>After a brief spell as a professor of physics at Cornell, Mr. Dyson returned to the Institute for Advanced Study in 1953 and has been in Princeton ever since. There he grew ever closer to Oppenheimer, and a section near the end of the book includes some moving letters from the year 1966-67, when, during the last stages of Oppenheimer's terminal cancer, Mr. Dyson tried to keep his friend alive "by keeping alive his interest in physics."</Para><Para>Overall, there is much in the letters collected here to enjoy; Mr. Dyson writes wonderfully well. But I am surely not alone in wishing that a man so brilliant, who has lived such an interesting life, had, at the end of his days, endeavored to write a proper autobiography. As Wittgenstein once observed, "Raisins might be the best thing about a cake; but a bag of raisins is not better than a cake."</Para><Para>Mr. Monk is a professor of philosophy at the University of Southampton and the biographer of Bertrand Russell, Ludwig Wittgenstein and J. Robert Oppenheimer.</Para></TailParas><Byline fid="by" index="field">By Ray Monk </Byline><Credit fid="cr" index="field"></Credit><Contact fid="ct" index="field"></Contact><Notes fid="rf" index="field"></Notes><Art fid="art" index="field"></Art><Copyright fid="cy" index="field">Copyright 2018 Dow Jones &amp; Company, Inc.
