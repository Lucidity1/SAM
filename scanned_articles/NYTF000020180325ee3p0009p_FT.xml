And even when shares can be sold at a gain, executives have to contend with thorny issues concerning diversification and the reputational risks of selling. It can be a tricky intersection in the corporate world of trusting your company's future versus protecting your own interests.</Para><Para>The first thing to remember when receiving substantial stock compensation, financial advisers say, is that no matter how stable your company, you are taking a gamble. Markets go up and down, and even the most stalwart stocks can take sudden turns.</Para><Para>Shares of General Electric climbed more or less steadily for decades until the year 2000, then tumbled. They regained some ground, but took another beating during the financial crisis. G.E. stock was climbing again in recent years, but last year began falling again.</Para><Para>''Whether founders or executives, these individuals have a different risk appetite than other W-2 earning individuals,'' said Jeff Schnitz, head of wealth advisory for Silicon Valley Bank's private bank. ''They have the opportunity to accept risk, and to create upside opportunities for themselves.''</Para><Para>Some chief executives are taking this to new extremes. Elon Musk recently proposed a new compensation plan at Tesla. If approved, he will receive billions of dollars in compensation if he manages to double, triple and quadruple the value of the company. He will receive nothing if he does not.</Para><Para>Rick Smith, the chief executive of Axon, followed Mr. Musk's lead and proposed a nearly identical plan, albeit with smaller targets for the market valuation.</Para><Para>Mr. Musk and Mr. Smith are outliers. But even for less ambitions executives, the same principle holds.</Para><Para>''You want the C.E.O. fully aligned and driving a strong return on the investment,'' said Shirl Penney, the founder of Dynasty Financial Partners. ''The investors want the senior leadership team as all in as possible.''</Para><Para>Not everyone is willing to put all their eggs in one basket, however. And for those making a mere few hundred thousand dollars, or even a few million a year, the need to diversify can be real.</Para><Para>''For someone who is more of a middle-line manager who is saving toward retirement, we would typically advise not having more than 10 percent of your net worth in any one security,'' said Mr. Penney. ''You try to advise someone to liquidate as much of their stock as possible and put it into a more diversified portfolio.''</Para><Para>That can be easy for an executive at a publicly traded company. But it can be virtually impossible for executives or founders at private start-ups, many of whom have preferred stock or founders shares that are illiquid until a sale or initial public offering.</Para><Para>''Selling or diversifying out of that stock has not only a financial ramification for it, but could have ramifications around who much control they have,'' said Mr. Penney.</Para><Para>And when start-up executives and founders do sell, the results can vary widely. Peter Thiel, an early investor in Facebook, has sold most all of his shares in the company, even as he remains a board member. It's a prudent bet -- Facebook shares are hovering near their all-time high.</Para><Para>But sometimes, selling too early can be disastrous. Ronald Wayne, a co-founder of Apple, sold his stake in the company for $800 in 1976. That stock would today have been worth about $90 billion today, making him one of the richest men in the world.</Para><Para>Even if an executive or founder does want to sell stock, they need to be careful about not timing any sales to create the impression that they have lost faith in the company, or were trading on nonpublic information.</Para><Para>Intel chief executive Brian Krzanich recently drew scrutiny for selling about $39 million worth of shares after the company learned of a major security flaw in its chips, but before the news was made public.</Para><Para>Intel said the sale was unrelated to security issues and was part of a prearranged annual trading plan.</Para><Para>Financial advisers said such considerations were left largely to the executives themselves. ''We're not really in the business of talking to C.E.O.s about the public perception of what they want to do,'' said Scott Senseney, head of sales, marketing and communications for Fidelity's stock plan services group.</Para><Para>Sophisticated financial planners have myriad ways to minimize risk, beyond simply diversifying. Executives with large stock holdings can hedge their positions, minimizing downside risk. Sometimes it's possible to sell upside call options.</Para><Para>And in so-called exchange funds, executives from various companies will pool their stock into a fund run by an asset manager, diversifying their exposure without having to sell shares and pay any immediate capital gains taxes.</Para><Para>Even then, however, undue complexity can backfire. In 2012, the founder of Green Mountain Coffee Roasters, Robert Stiller, was ousted as chairman of his own company after he sold five million shares, worth about $125 million. His motivation: he had taken out loans against his sizable stake in Green Mountain, now known as Keurig Green Mountain, but when the value of the shares fell, Mr. Stiller was caught in a margin call.</Para><Para>The most common pitfall for executives who are rewarded with stock, however, is simply ignorance. Too often, planners say, executives don't know what they have, or what options they are entitled to. Frequently, people become aware of their options only at the last minute, or even after the fact.</Para><Para>''The worst-case scenario is that those options expire in the money,'' said Mr. Senseney. ''Waiting too long can be devastating. There can be millions of dollars of impact.''</Para></TailParas><Byline fid="by" index="field">By DAVID GELLES </Byline><Credit fid="cr" index="field"></Credit><Contact fid="ct" index="field"></Contact><Notes fid="rf" index="field">Follow David Gelles on Twitter @dgelles and LinkedIn. </Notes><Art fid="art" index="field">Top, Elon Musk proposed a unique compensation plan at Tesla.
