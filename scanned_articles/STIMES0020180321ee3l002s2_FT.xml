It was her worst nightmare come true.</Para><Para>National Neuroscience Institute principal radiographer Oh Hui Ping, 34, had roped in her younger brother Zhi Long to do a trial run on a new MRI (Magnetic Resonance Imaging) machine at the Institute.</Para></LeadPara></HandL><TailParas fid="td"><Para>But as she moved the mouse controlling which part of the brain was being scanned, she came across a white patch in the image that stood out among the grey mass of the brain.</Para><Para>Her thoughts were in turmoil.</Para><Para>"What is that? Is it a tumour? Is it malignant? What are these changes in the white matter of the brain?" she recalled, the questions tumbling out one after another as a feeling of dread came over her.</Para><Para>Zhi Long, an auditor, 32, was immediately sent for more tests which confirmed the bad news - he had a medium-sized tumour in the left frontal lobe, a critical part of the brain involved in movement, language, decision making, emotions and personality.</Para><Para>"I'm a healthcare professional, I couldn't cry in front of Zhi Long or my family. I could only show my fear and my emotions when I went home to my husband," said Ms Oh. "But it was extremely stressful."</Para><Para>The family, father retired storeman Oh Han Kok, 57, mother Seng Kiah Eng, 57, a housewife, Ms Oh and sister Hui Shan, 30, a dental hygienist, were all there to give their love and support when Zhi Long was wheeled into the operating theatre just days later, and waiting with relieved smiles when he was wheeled back out after the successful operation.</Para><Para>The atmosphere is relaxed on the morning of the operation on March 28, 2017. With Mr Oh are his younger sister Oh Hui Shan (far right) and his elder sister Oh Hui Ping.

Q&amp;A with NNI medical director Ng Wai Hoe</Para><Para>Of the experience, which lasted over four hours, the younger Mr Oh remembers very little.</Para><Para>"For my first surgery, it was quite a major one," he told The Straits Times, speaking from his family's five-room flat in Woodlands.</Para><Para>"I feel like there was some loss to my short-term memory, and there were some things I said which I can't recall.</Para><Para>"It took about two weeks to feel back to normal."</Para><Para>But thanks to his family and the support of his employer KPMG, which gave him time off to recover, he has since done well following 30 radiotherapy sessions and eight months' of chemotherapy.</Para><Para>The silver lining, that "accidental scan" had detected the cancerous and potentially aggressive lump even before Zhi Long had concrete symptoms, which could eventually show up as behavioural changes, memory loss and paralysis.</Para><Para>So he got treatment fast.</Para><Para>Mr Oh feeding his prized marine clown fish at his home almost three months after his brain surgery on June 26, 2017. When he was hospitalised, he would ask his mother to take video footage of his fish for him to look at.
