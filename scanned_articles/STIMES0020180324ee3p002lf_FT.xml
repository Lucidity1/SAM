from it</Para><Para>I have a love-hate relationship with Facebook. If there was a status update for Facebook, it would read: It's complicated.</Para></LeadPara></HandL><TailParas fid="td"><Para>I've been on Facebook for years, and come to love it. I check it frequently for work reasons, to read what others are posting and commenting on. As Opinion editor, I use it to promote and share commentaries published in The Straits Times. I use Messenger to harangue contributors, asking them to write for The Straits Times. I'm sometimes able to identify topics that whet their interests, by looking at what they have been posting.</Para><Para>I obsessively click through on my Facebook friends' many, interesting articles. I selectively Like, Feel Sad or Love them. I count the number of times friends Like my post, Comment on it, or Share it.</Para><Para>When I'm feeling lonesome, it gives me a sense of community and connection with others. Never mind if I'm in a foul mood that day; on Facebook I can post cheery updates, engage people I have never met in serious conversations or bantering ones, and then feel better.</Para><Para>Facebook can be an emotional crutch, and I, of all people, who work, eat, live and breathe news and information, should know.</Para><Para>Then, last Wednesday, I sat in my office Toast Box cafe, and slowly scrolled through my list of Facebook apps, and deleted them one by one. After about 30 minutes, I had only removed about 50 of them. I hadn't even known I had given permission to these apps to reside on my Facebook account, let alone to mine my account for my personal data, and my friends' data.</Para><Para>ST ILLUSTRATION: MIEL</Para><Para>By Wednesday evening, as more information about Cambridge Analytica broke, I had enough. I started drafting a Facebook post that said: "Fed Up. Going on Facebook fast for the rest of Lent."</Para><Para>Then the irony of taking to Facebook to announce my intention to withdraw from it - which would compel me to check feverishly to see what my friends thought of the decision - struck me.</Para><Para>I deleted that post. Instead, I went to settings, clicked on general account settings, picked manage account, and hit Deactivate.</Para><Para>I couldn't bring myself to #deleteFacebook. I could only deactivate it. Like I said, it's complicated. There might be some co-dependency going on.</Para><Para>Deactivating my Facebook account was an act of pique, a gesture of annoyance at the social media giant for the way it has acted.</Para><Para>It has certainly been less than upfront about the fact that it had let third-party apps access users' data and users' friends list, without their permission.</Para><Para>Many netizens are willing to trade some privacy for the convenience and connections of being on social media networks. But that relationship with the social media platform must be based on trust.</Para><Para>When it found out that such data, from 270,000 users who took part in an initial survey in 2014, had been passed on to data analytics company Cambridge Analytica (CA), it requested that CA delete the data. CA said Okay. This was in 2015. Facebook didn't check if it had done so, and kept mum about it.</Para><Para>Until March 2018, when a whistle-blower went to the media with the story.</Para><Para>CA reportedly used some of those data to build a database of 50 million profiles of voters and used it to help its client, Mr Donald Trump, win the 2016 United States presidential campaign, so the stakes are high.</Para><Para>The social media giant is now in hot soup. Its executives have been grilled in the British and Singapore Parliaments, and likely, the United States Congress is next. The US Federal Trade Commission (FTC) is investigating if Facebook violated an earlier promise to get users' consent before harvesting their data.</Para><Para>As a Facebook user, I've often found it sneaky when it comes to privacy issues.</Para><Para>Many of us will take some care to set privacy settings when we first set up an account, or once we get the hang of using it. I've certainly gone into Facebook to specify who can see what information, or who can post items to my timeline, and even who can send me friend requests.</Para><Para>A few years ago, I was puzzled as to why those settings did not appear to be respected. Then I read in the news that Facebook was changing default settings without telling users!</Para><Para>In 2011, it was taken to task by the FTC over its privacy settings policy and was asked to get user consent for certain changes to privacy settings.</Para><Para>At that time, a news report highlighted FTC's description of Facebook's "deceptive and unfair practices": "For example, it said Facebook promised users that it would not share personal information with advertisers, but it did. Also, the company had failed to warn users that it was changing its website in December 2009 so that certain information that users had designated as private, such as their 'Friends List', would be made public."</Para><Para>As part of that investigation and subsequent settlement, Facebook was also forced to subject itself to 20 years of independent audits.</Para><Para>So, one would think Facebook would have learnt to take data privacy much more seriously right? For example, surely the privacy settings you set are cast in stone?</Para><Para>Unfortunately, no. Because there are settings, and there are settings, and smartphone apps and Facebook apps are so smart, most of us have no clue what permission we are giving them and what liberties they are taking with our personal information when we download an app.</Para><Para>After all, Facebook is just a platform on which thousands of apps ride. Smart developers are designing fun, interactive games and quizzes that lure you into taking part. For example, I'm a sucker for psychological quizzes. What mythological Greek goddess do I take after? What colour appeals to me naturally? What does my profile picture say about my sociability/ physical age/ sociopathic tendencies? I often while away minutes before bed doing these quizzes.</Para><Para>Until last Wednesday when I started looking at app permissions, I hadn't realised that answering those quizzes also meant I had inadvertently let them take up permanent residency in my account, and permitted them to trawl my data and even my friends'.</Para><Para>In fact, it looks like a lot more than lists of names, workplaces, and birthdates are being harvested. Location data, likes, dislikes, what you search for, and what you click through to see, are all potential goldmines.</Para><Para>As we now know, that initial 270,000 users' data became 50 million users, as the app trawled their contacts. This is not so surprising, when you consider that if each person has just 200 contacts, that 270,000 users will have 54 million contacts in all.</Para><Para>What profile can it build of those 50 million users? CA itself admitted recently that it had "5,000 data points on over 230 million American voters", or almost the entire US population. Capturing so many data points translate to a very high level of granularity in figuring out what makes a person tick - and selling that information en masse to advertisers.</Para><Para>I wouldn't mind so much if advertisers targeted me to sell things like handbags. At one phase, I was clicking through many handbag ads, and I was quite pleased to see more such ads popping up on my feed. I enjoyed watching videos from crowdfunded stores promising the world's best office laptop handbag for women, or a smart travel jacket with pockets for all your devices.</Para><Para>But I would hate for my personal data to be sold to people who want to get into my brain to influence my vote or my ideas, or to manipulate me into joining a protest, an organisation or a riot.</Para><Para>Personal agency is very important, especially in an age of social media nudges and algorithm-defined news that pull us along predefined paths. I would like to think I can remain an autonomous person with my own views and preferences, and not be some rag doll jerked here and there by some master-puppeteer.</Para><Para>Apart from the US, Facebook is also facing the heat in Germany for consent issues.</Para><Para>Reuters reported last month : "The Federation of German Consumer Organisations (VZVB) said that Facebook's default settings and some of its terms of service were in breach of consumer law, and that the court had found parts of the consent to data usage to be invalid.</Para><Para>'Facebook hides default settings that are not privacy-friendly in its privacy centre and does not provide sufficient information about it when users register,' said Mr Heiko Duenkel, litigation policy officer at the VZVB."</Para><Para>The report added: "The Federal Cartel Office, in an interim update on an investigation into Facebook, said in December that it objected to the way the company gains access to third-party data when an account is opened.</Para><Para>"This includes tapping information from its own WhatsApp and Instagram products - as well as how it tracks which sites its users access.</Para><Para>"One concern highlighted by the consumer rights group was that, in Facebook's app for smartphones, a service was pre-activated that revealed the user's location to the person he was chatting to.</Para><Para>"Also, in the privacy settings, ticks were already placed in boxes that allowed search engines to link to the user's timeline, meaning that anyone would be able quickly and easily to find a user's profile.</Para><Para>'The judges ruled that all five of the default settings on Facebook that VZVB complained about are invalid,' the group said in a statement, adding that several other of Facebook's terms of use were found to be illegal."</Para><Para>This was just a month ago. It does not look like Facebook's track record on user privacy has substantively improved.</Para><Para>Many netizens are willing to trade some privacy for the convenience and connections of being on social media networks. But that relationship with the social media platform must be based on trust.</Para><Para>Platforms have to show they are trustworthy custodians of data. After all, data is their gold. They should be treasuring it, protecting it, and harvesting it for only the highest yields, not hawking it like some tawdry ware and handing it over lock, stock and barrel to any third-party app.</Para><Para>Facebook has to evolve from being sneaky to being responsible. Its sneakiness may have sprung from its roots as an undergrad jock page to rate girls. But these days, with over two billion users and US$40 billion (S$52.6 billion) in annual revenue from selling those data, it has to grow up.</Para><Para>Deactivating Facebook means I'm taking time out from my relationship. But a part of me hopes the frat boy grows up real fast and learns not to take its users for granted.</Para></TailParas><Byline fid="by" index="field">Chua Mui Hoong </Byline><Credit fid="cr" index="field"></Credit><Contact fid="ct" index="field"></Contact><Notes fid="rf" index="field"></Notes><Art fid="art" index="field"></Art><Copyright fid="cy" index="field">(c) 2018 Singapore Press Holdings Limited </Copyright></Article></ArchiveDoc><AdocTOC adoctype="article"><Item size="0" ref="distdoc:archive/ArchiveDoc::Article" type="arttext"></Item><Item size="0" ref="distdoc:archive/InvertText" type="invtext"></Item></AdocTOC></DistDoc>
