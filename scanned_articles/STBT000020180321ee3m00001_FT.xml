rocket rise of Creative Technology - it became a seven-bagger in seven sessions after spending a good part of a decade slip-sliding away - presents the tempting suggestion that tech has re-ignited the local bourse.</Para><Para>As Creative proved earlier this month, Singapore's retail crowd is more than willing to take a punt on a stock that's developed an exciting new technology, months before the first widget has been shipped or its first order closed.</Para></LeadPara></HandL><TailParas fid="td"><Para>"#MakeCreativeGreatAgain," one market watcher cried on an online stock forum, where information, misinformation and euphoria are exchanged.</Para><Para>"Make Singapore Stocks Great Again," cheered another, because Singapore "really got technopreuners one (sic)"!</Para><Para>"The Jedi has returned," another commentator began. If any sell-side analyst wrote a negative note on Singapore's best-known mainboard-listed consumer technology firm, it never reached the public.</Para><Para>Creative's surprise comeback was like a condensed form of bitcoin fever in the early days, with the small guys getting in on the trade before the smart money, their improbable gains forcing the fund managers to scratch their heads and book demo sessions with Creative's eccentric boss Sim Wong Hoo.</Para><Para>The shares touched an intra-day high of S$10 on March 6, sparking rumours that stock operators may have been involved. Mr Sim says he's heard the same thing, although this is not the case. Himself, he's not so concerned about his market value.</Para><Para>Creative's shares were worth S$1.25 on Feb 22 before The Business Times ran a story on Creative's new Super X-Fi headphone holography. The prototype can turn two-dimensional sound into 3D on a pair of headphones.</Para><Para>Creative's share price has since come back a little closer to earth, closing at S$5.84 on Wednesday.</Para><Para>Until punters hopped on for Creative Technology's rocket ride, the rally in Singapore stocks that was broadly referred to as a "tech rally" was really a reference to a subset of the manufacturing sector that had gone high tech, or had an exposure to tech stocks in the US.</Para><Para>Driven by profit growth and other cyclical factors, some tech manufacturing stocks that have become multi-baggers over the past year include Venture Corp, the global electronics services provider; semiconductor test handler maker AEM Holdings and contract manufacturer Hi-P International.</Para><Para>Yet Venture, AEM and Hi-P are not what you'd call "tech" stocks in the same sense that their customers – Illumina, Intel, Apple and Amazon – are tech stocks.</Para><Para>While the strength of Singapore's tech fever rally (or was it FOMO, the fear of missing out?) may have emboldened the Creative crowd, Creative's rally represents a different kind of animal.</Para><Para>Unlike Singapore's classic tech manufacturing stocks – and rather like many fledgling tech startups and lesser-covered tech stocks in the Singapore universe – loss-making Creative doesn't yet have the revenue or profit growth to show for.</Para><Para>In a sense, that makes Creative Technology the quintessential tech stock. Or should we say, "story stock"?</Para><Para>Ultimately, whether Creative turns out to be a story stock or a turnaround play will depend on how well it executes its Super X-Fi strategy.</Para><Para>Creative is a high-risk investment because the company has a track record that's far from perfect, and it's sales strategy for the Super X-Fi is not entirely clear yet.</Para><Para>The Sound Blaster sound card was an easy sell until its importance was diminished, and Creative's sales and marketing team has yet to prove it can pack a punch.</Para><Para>In the early 1990s, Creative also took a big bet on the manufacture of CD-ROM drives that led to huge write-offs of unsold inventory, although the company did manage to avoid ruin.</Para><Para>And if the Super X-Fi is, like Mr Sim says, the "holy grail" of headphone audio, you can bet that anyone who is anyone in audio technology would have some highly-paid engineers on his tail. (Godspeed, Mr Sim.)</Para><Para>Everyone wants to see a Singapore winner. And Creative, which began as a small computer repair shop in 1981, has brought some life back to the local bourse.</Para><Para>Discerning investors</Para><Para>But as much as everyone wants a Singapore giant to succeed, to say that Creative is fronting a tech revival on the Singapore Exchange would be to jump the gun.</Para><Para>So far, what this episode has proven is that Singapore investors have the guts to support entrepreneurs with vision and people who build real technology, and not because they are stupid either. In fact Singapore's stock investors are a pretty discerning bunch, otherwise they'd already have ditched this scene to be crypto traders.</Para><Para>When Catalist-listed Spackman Entertainment Group said in February it planned to launch its own cryptocurrency called Korean entertainment utility tokens – or K Coins – through an initial coin offering (ICO), no one bid Spackman to the moon, did they?</Para><Para>Creative Technology is proof that investors here are familiar with the concept that you may have to suffer big risks to get a chance at big rewards.</Para><Para>So even as newer and flashier homegrown brands like Razer and Sea have steered away from Singapore to opt for an overseas listing, this episode should make the talking heads think twice before they pooh-pooh the local bourse as a second-rate destination for tech companies to list or raise money. Maybe Singapore can be a great tech venue after all. We just haven't been given enough shots to prove it.</Para></TailParas><Byline fid="by" index="field">Marissa Lee , Singapore bourse finds Creative spark, but whither the tech boom? </Byline><Credit fid="cr" index="field"></Credit><Contact fid="ct" index="field"></Contact><Notes fid="rf" index="field"></Notes><Art fid="art" index="field"></Art><Copyright fid="cy" index="field">(c) 2018 Singapore Press Holdings Limited </Copyright></Article></ArchiveDoc><AdocTOC adoctype="article"><Item size="0" ref="distdoc:archive/ArchiveDoc::Article" type="arttext"></Item><Item size="0" ref="distdoc:archive/InvertText" type="invtext"></Item></AdocTOC></DistDoc>
