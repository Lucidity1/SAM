We got to meet a lovely young couple, who really when you see the extent of damage to their house, the fact they have two little children, in some ways it is a blessing they weren’t there that night. But when you realise how many families, after the first adrenaline rush, when they come and see the damage they realise we have to start, we have to rebuild, we have to put things back together again, it is clearing out flood and storm damage, it is the fences, it is the tress, it is the green waste – these things might sound mundane to a stranger but, when you actually have to confront starting again... some stuff will never be replaced. I just think it is important for the people of Darwin and Palmerston to know that the rest of Australia is aware, is concerned and is there to be supported. That is what Aussies do, we are there to look after each other.</Para><Para>block-time updated-timeUpdated at 4.21am GMT</Para><Para>block-time published-time 4.10am GMT</Para><Para>Bill Shorten is in Darwin, inspecting the damage from Cyclone Marcus, the day after <ELink type="webpage" ref="https://www.theguardian.com/weather/2018/mar/21/cyclone-marcus-turnbull-sends-thoughts-five-days-after-storm-hit-darwin">this story </ELink> was released.</Para><Para>I am not sure that people in other parts of Australia quite realised the extent of Cyclone Marcus and the impact it had on Darwin. Clearly, Darwin is resilient community and the wisdom of some of the building standards introduced after 1974, the wisdom has been vindicated. Having said that, this is the first cyclone to hit directly on Darwin in 30 years. Anyone who travels along the roads, even three or four days afterwards, they see the scale of the trees that have collapsed and fallen over. You realise that it was a very, very big wind that hit Darwin. I think it is a miracle that there were no serious injuries nor loss of life. In someways, in no small way, that is a reflection of people having Cyclone plans. When I look at the damage that has been done and the potential for loss of life, the first reaction I have when I visit Darwin and see first hand is thank goodness. A miracle that somebody was not injured or killed. Having said that, Darwin has been hard hit and the rest of Australia should not underestimate [the damage].</Para><Para>block-time updated-timeUpdated at 4.22am GMT</Para><Para>block-time published-time 4.02am GMT</Para><Para>Meanwhile, the ACTU has released its own letter to senators asking them not to support the company tax cuts:</Para><Para>enltrACTU has written to the crossbench on company tax cuts.

In a separate incident, in October 2017, it was reported that when considering a buyback from cotton producer Webster Limited for a property in western New South Wales, the former water minister ignored the department’s own valuation and paid nearly double what the water was worth. Why is it, minister, that every time the Nationals get their hands on the water portfolio, rich cotton producers get richer and every other taxpayer gets ripped off and the river suffered?</Para><Para>Matt Canavan :</Para><Para>Unfortunately it contained a number of incorrect claims. The water purchase from Eastern Australian Agriculture was for water, an amount of water that was greater than five times than the figures or the price that was quoted in the media that you refer to in your answer, Senator Hanson-Young. So it is incorrect, it is absolutely incorrect to say that the government paid a price above the seller’s price, and I will take that interjection because you are right Senator Hanson-Young that we have released documents on this matter and those documents, if you had paid the time to take attention to them, did show that the original sale offer that you referred to was very different from the final purchase because those documents show that the amount of water purchase was a lot more than originally offered. When you end up getting a lot more, when you end up getting a lot more than was offered, of course the [inaudible] had to be higher as well. Now, Mr President, I can assure you and this chamber that the government’s purchase of water have been advised through independent analysis and valuation. We are confident that we have purchased water at good value for money for the taxpayer and we are confident that these water purchases will help deliver the environmental objectives and outcome of the Murray-Darling basin plan that the government is committed to making sure that we do deliver. We are trying our best to get this delivery done in the clear politicisation and opposition that we have seen to independent advice from your side and the Labor side who have ignored the results of the northern basin review and have put at risk the plan which is to the benefit of the whole Murray-Darling.</Para><Para>Hanson-Young:</Para><Para>This is a pattern of behaviour that every time the Nationals pay their mates for water, the taxpayer ends up paying more than the water is worth. Can the minister describe, is this a rort, is it a kickback or is it just good old-fashioned pork-barrelling for the National party at the cost of the taxpayer just to look after your mates?</Para><Para>Canavan:</Para><Para>I do agree with an aspect of Senator Hanson-Young’s question. Just a tiny aspect. There is a pattern of behaviour here, Mr President. There clearly is a pattern of behaviour. There is a pattern of behaviour from the Australian Greens that they don’t do their homework before they come in here. They rely on media articles from the Guardian or Fairfax without themselves looking at the documents I quoted in my first question are publicly available. So, Mr President, Senator Hanson-Young can reduce herself to investigate and confected claims, but I would encourage her to look at the documents that the government has transparently released in this case that clearly show that the allegations in the articles Senator Hanson-Young referred to were wrong, incorrect and the government is confident that with are getting value for money for the purchase of water in the Murray-Darling basin plan.</Para><Para>Hanson-Young:</Para><Para>My final supplementary is in relation to reports that the head of the northern Murray-Darling basin group Fred Hooper was told by an adviser in the minister’s office that he had received $10m if he could convince Labor to backflip on their opposition to the Northern Basin Review Disallowance back if February. Did the minister approve this $180m bribe? Who knew about it and did it go to cabinet?</Para><Para>Canavan:</Para><Para>I can [inform] Senator Hanson-Young that at no point did we offer funding to this group to secure the amendments. The government was in negotiations with both Labor and the crossbench to gain support for the Murray-Darling basin plan. Those negotiations of course were not successful as the northern basin review amendments were disallowed by the Senate. Mr President, as I was mentioning earlier, it is a shame in my view that those amendments, those northern review basin amendments weren’t passed because they were based on independent advice.</Para><Para>block-time updated-timeUpdated at 3.59am GMT</Para><Para>block-time published-time 3.43am GMT</Para><Para>Peter Georgiou had some questions about the royal commission into the banks.</Para><Para>The answer boiled down to this:</Para><Para>Mathias Cormann:</Para><Para>The government is focused on the public interest.

Why did the prime minister mislead the South Australian people about the minister’s plans?</Para><Para>Payne:</Para><Para>There is absolutely no question of any misleading being done whatsoever. What the material which is being referred to says and says sensibly, Mr President, is that in the planning process for a build of future submarines that will be undertaken in South Australia, the future has to be examined in terms of the size of the build that is required to be done, the size of the flare that is required to be established at Osborne and so on. I referred to a number of those matters in answer to a question by Senator Patrick yesterday. What is interesting, Mr President, is we can only have a discussion about this issue because this government is getting on with the job of delivering a future submarine capability for Australia, unlike those opposite who in the entire time of their period in office did not place one single order for one vessel built in Australia for the royal Australian navy. Not one.</Para><Para>Cameron:</Para><Para>I would ask, minister, on what date did the minute Pyne direct Defence to suspend work on the relocation plan and why was that work suspended?</Para><Para>Payne:</Para><Para>As I think has been discussed at estimates, not sure if you were in the room at the time or not Senator Carr, but obviously the work that proceeds in relation to the planning under the naval ship plan is based on a range of priorities, that includes the infrastructure being done as Osborne and the work being done for the future frigates and the offshore patrol senator vessels...</Para><Para>(Cameron interrupts to say he just wanted a date)</Para><Para>Payne:</Para><Para>I don’t have a specific date with me. I am very happy to take that matter on notice and advice to the Senate. However, what I would say is that the only reason we are in a position of needing to manage the presence at Osborne, the size of the development at Osborne, the infrastructure creation at Osborne, is because this government has not only commissioned 12 new future submarines for Australia but also 42 future frigates and 12 offshore patrol vessels. Fifty-four vessels in total. In sharp contrast to those opposite who did nothing but, most importantly, did nothing to address the jobs issue that is attached to it.</Para><Para>Cameron:</Para><Para>Given the work on their location study was clearly staged to avoid political pitfalls, such as Senate estimates, the state elections, how can the government deny having politicised the defence department processes? Isn’t it now obvious that under Minister Pyne with the naval shipbuilding plan, it has now become nothing more that a Liberal party marginal seats plan?</Para><Para>Payne:</Para><Para>[I missed the first line but she disagreed with the premise of the question]... This government is getting on with the business of delivering capability for the Royal Australian Navy. Offshore patrol vessels, future frigates and future submarines not to mention some for our regional neighbours, as you would be aware. Fifty-four vessels in total. That is extremely complex and is overseen with a naval ship-building plan which the minister should be familiar with. It is underpinned by a vast amount of work being done within the department, within the organisation, which the senator himself has asked about in estimates but chooses conveniently to forget some of those discussions when it comes to a day like today or a question like today. Mr President, most importantly, ships commissioned by those opposite, the Labor party, when in government?

Is this analysis correct? If not, why not?</Para><Para>Cormann:</Para><Para>I am not aware of that particular analysis but what I would say to you is the prospect of a return on your investment is precisely what we need in order to attract more investment into Australia so we can continue to develop our economy, create more jobs and create the environment for higher wages. I mean, the whole point, Australia needs foreign capital to develop our economy to its full potential and the more competitive that we are in offering the opportunity for the higher return, higher profits, the more capital that we will attract, the better we are able to improve our productivity. The more we are actually able to ensure that we can generate in returns for our businesses, and the more successful our businesses are, the more people they can hire as they grow. The more people businesses want to hire, the more competition there is for workers. The more competition there is for workers, the more the businesses have to pay to secure their services. I mean, this is what this is all about. I mean the whole reason we need to have an internationally competitive business tax rate is so that we can successfully compete for investment from around the world into Australia.</Para><Para>Carr:</Para><Para>I refer to Moody’s investment service, which says in relation to US tax cuts: ‘We do not expect corporate tax cuts to lead to a meaningful boost to business investment, which has remained tepid despite a support of economic environment. What guarantee can the minister provide senators that the Turnbull government’s $65b handout to big business will lead to a meaningful boost in business investment?</Para><Para>Cormann:</Para><Para>Firstly, I would say, if you look at the actual evidence in the real world, the tax cuts which were legislated through the US Congress reducing the corporate tax rate down to 21% has led to an immediate boost in investment. It has led to an immediate boost to capital returning to the US. It has led to an immediate boost in confidence. It has led to an immediate increase in the number of Americans getting job. It has led to an immediate increase to remuneration. International Monetary Fund upgraded the global economic growth outlook on the back of the Trump tax cut that passed the Senate. Whatever your view is on the Trump tax cuts, the reality is they are there. It is like the mountains in Switzerland, they are there. That now means that the tax rate in the United States is 9% lower than here in Australia. We can put our head in the sand and say ‘won’t have any implications for any businesses here in Australia’. The truth is it will. If we don’t pass business tax cuts we will hurt the economy.</Para><Para>Carr:</Para><Para>Over the past two years, wages have grown by only 4% while company profits have increased by a massive 32%, eight times faster than wages. Why should senators believe that $65bn handout to big business will flee through to wage growth when companies seeing massive profits have not passed it onto their employees?</Para><Para>Cormann:</Para><Para>The sad thing is Senator Cameron doesn’t understand economics. We have gone through a period of slow global growth and we have gone through a significant economic transition in Australia with significant drops in our prices for our commodity exports and, of course, instead of having massive increases in unemployment under our government, we have seen massive increases in employment. Over the last five months we’ve had 420,000 new jobs.</Para><Para>The truth is wages growth has been picking up as the economy has continued to improve. We want wages growth to pick up more and that is of course why we need businesses to be more profitable and more successful because, if they are less profitable and less successful, let me tell you they will hire fewer people and pay them less. That is common sense. Do you think a less successful business will be able to hire more people and pay them better wages?</Para><Para>*I originally wrote Doug Cameron asked these questions.

Honestly, it feels like 84 years since the section 44 crisis hit the parliament. And it’s not over yet but the Senate, at least, seems pretty happy to have the House have to deal with the rest.</Para><Para>Labor is preparing for the government’s coming attacks over its tax dividend policy, with both sides looking to next week as one of the last chances to catch voters attention before minds switch off from politics for the holidays.

I have since been advised that the correct statement should be more than half of all individuals receiving refunded franking credits have taxable income less than the $18,200 tax-free threshold.</Para><Para>She had originally said:</Para><Para>“More than half of all refunded franking credits are paid to individuals who earn less than the $18,200 tax-free threshold, including pensioners and self-funded retirees. Ninety-seven per cent of people who receive franking credit refunds have a taxable income below $87,000 – people who have worked hard, saved hard and paid tax.”</Para><Para>The difference being between being “earned” and “taxable income”, which was the Grattan Institute researchers’ point, as well as Labor’s.</Para><Para>All of this means we’ll be seeing more Connie in question time later today.</Para><Para>So let’s get to it.
