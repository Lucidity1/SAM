chief</Para></Headline></Title><LeadPara fid="lp"><Para>Trade Commissioner Cecilia Malmstr√∂m has many things to contend with, including US tariffs, Brexit and China.</Para><Para>WHILE pursuing her degree in political science at Gothenburg University in Sweden in the early 1990s, the European Union's Trade Commissioner Cecilia Malmstr√∂m financed her studies by working as a psychiatric nurse for three years.</Para></LeadPara></HandL><TailParas fid="td"><Para>"It was very good preparation for the world of politics," she said.</Para><Para>How so?</Para><Para>"Well, I have met all kinds of people. Nothing really surprises me."</Para><Para>Ms Malmstr√∂m, 49, has been in politics since she was in university, as an activist in Sweden's Liberal party. In 1999, at the age of 31, she was elected to the European Parliament, where she served till 2006.</Para><Para>After spending four years as Sweden's Minister for European Affairs, she returned to Brussels to become the EU's Commissioner for Home Affairs. In November 2014, she took on the massive and important trade portfolio which covers 28 countries.</Para><Para>I interviewed Ms Malmstr√∂m the day after US President Donald Trump announced tariffs on US imports of steel and aluminium. She was understandably not in the cheeriest of moods.</Para><Para>Reacting to the tariffs, the famously tough-talking Ms Malmstr√∂m did not mince words. "It's not rational," she said, and Mr Trump's invocation of national security as a reason for the tariffs "makes it even more upsetting". Her tone sharpened. "You invoke national security only under very specific circumstances. And you certainly do not do it against your closest allies and security partners in Nato."</Para><Para>"The US wants to hit China. Well, if they want to hit China, they should have chosen another way to do that." The fact that China is hardly affected by the tariffs is "even more proof that it is not a good measure", she added.</Para><Para>She argued that the EU, as well as other US allies such as Canada, Japan and South Korea should be excluded from the tariffs. "Things could change, but as of now, he is hitting the whole world in a non-discriminatory manner. We will all suffer collateral damage." (Subsequently, when formally authorising the tariffs, Mr Trump agreed to exclude Canada and Mexico, but not the EU.)</Para><Para>"We will be affected quite a lot," said Ms Malmstr√∂m. "We have at least 10 countries who are steel exporters, some of them directly to the US. We have tens of thousands of people working in the steel and aluminium sectors in Europe. There will be changes in prices and distortions of markets, so we will see indirect effects as well.''</Para><Para>She was not ready to say how the EU would respond to the tariffs. But later, the EU threatened retaliation, drawing up a list of iconic US products to target, including Harley Davidson motorcycles, Levi's jeans and Kentucky bourbon whisky.</Para><Para>On the broader EU-US trade relationship, I asked Ms Malmstr√∂m about the state of play on the Transatlantic Trade and Investment Partnership - a proposed comprehensive agreement with the United States, which she has strongly supported.</Para><Para>"It's in the freezer," she said. "And the US has not shown any interest in taking it out. It makes a lot of sense to have a trade agreement with the US. We are the two biggest economies in the world - and to facilitate trade and regulatory cooperation between us makes absolute sense," she added. "If we take it out of the freezer - and I hope one day we can - we'll have to approach it slightly differently, because lots of things would have changed, and there is also a different attitude in the US. But it's not going to happen immediately."</Para><Para>But the EU maintains a continuous dialogue on trade issues with the office of US Trade Representative Robert Lighthizer.</Para><Para>"We meet in international fora and we talk over the phone. There are issues on which we agree and issues on which we don't agree. We profoundly disagree on their refusal to appoint arbitrators in the appellate court of the WTO (World Trade Organization) for instance. We have passed that message very clearly. We have also passed the message that imposing steel tariffs on Europe for security reasons is not good. But we agree that there is a problem of overproduction of steel in the world. We would like to explore working together, and with others, to see if we can make countries like China follow global trade rules in a better way. On certain issues in the WTO such as e-commerce, we're more or less in agreement."</Para><Para>DEALING WITH BREXIT</Para><Para>Another thorny issue that looms large on Ms Malmstr√∂m's agenda is negotiating with the UK on trade arrangements in the run-up to Britain's departure from the EU - the so-called "Brexit" - which is due to happen in March 2019.</Para><Para>The main problem at the moment, said Ms Malmstr√∂m, is that the UK has not made its position clear. "What do they want? I don't know. Maybe (British Prime Minister) Theresa May will clarify this. But the problem now is, we don't know what they want."</Para><Para>Ms Malmstr√∂m made clear that the UK cannot start negotiating trade agreements with other countries before it leaves the EU. "That is constitutionally impossible."</Para><Para>Nor can the EU continue to include the UK in its own trade agreements after March 2019. "We have about 40 trade agreements with the rest of the world that the UK will be leaving. How they want to do things after that is absolutely up to them."</Para><Para>But then, would not the UK then face the daunting prospect of leaving the EU with no trade agreements with any country? "Yes, exactly," said Ms Malmstr√∂m. "Maybe they should have thought of that before they voted."</Para><Para>As to how easily, and how soon, the EU can have a free trade agreement with the UK, post-Brexit, she said that a lot of questions first need to be addressed. "Will it be a soft Brexit or a hard Brexit? Will they follow our standards or not? How will they set standards if they don't? How will the dispute settlement process work if they refuse to follow the European Court of Justice? All that needs to be on the table before we start negotiating.</Para><Para>"We have no interest in making life more difficult for the UK,' she continued. "But we cannot negotiate with a partner that has not put their negotiating cards on the table. They haven't because they can't seem to agree internally. We are good at negotiating trade agreements so we have no reason to delay. But we need to know what they want."</Para><Para>CHINA COMPLICATIONS</Para><Para>Dealing with China is another challenge that Ms Malmstr√∂m has to grapple with. The EU has some 30 cases against China at the WTO.</Para><Para>"China is a complicated partner, but it's an important partner," she said. "We trade a lot with China, and would like to trade more. We have been in negotiations on an investment agreement with China to level the playing field. We have not made enormous progress. We welcome Chinese investments in Europe, but we have reports from our companies that it is becoming more difficult to invest in China. European and American investment in China is going down, because it's complicated, it's discriminatory, it's not transparent. They have strong state-owned companies which don't compete under the same conditions as other companies. They also sometimes close down the Internet which is a complication for companies, and they have human rights violations.</Para><Para>"We would like to level the playing field a little. We were very encouraged by the speech by China's president in Davos last year (where he spoke in favour of globalisation and open trade) but we have not really seen any action to follow up on that vision.</Para><Para>"So, when our companies are unfairly hit, we have to act. We have trade defence instruments and have just modernised them. So we are better prepared. This is not only for China - our instruments are, of course, country-neutral."</Para><Para>How challenging is it to manage the EU's trade portfolio given the widespread negative sentiments around free trade, I asked Ms Malmstr√∂m.</Para><Para>"That makes it even more important for those of us who believe in fair, free and open trade to stand up," she said. "The solution is for countries to work together. That is why what we are doing, for example, between Asean and EU is so important. We send a clear message to the world, that although the agreement is not there yet, we want to do it because we believe in fair and open trade. We also have these massive FTAs (free trade agreements) - either completed or in negotiations - with Canada, Japan, Mexico, Mercosur, Chile, and soon with Australia and New Zealand. This shows that many of us believe in trade."</Para><Para>But while many governments are indeed pro-trade, how is the EU addressing the anti-trade sentiments that are running high in many societies?</Para><Para>She explained that the EU has undergone "a very important shift" in its trade policy. "We re-engage with business, trade unions, civil society, environmental groups, consumer groups, inviting them, listening to their concerns, taking their advice.</Para><Para>"I have travelled all across the EU, addressed hundreds of town hall meetings. We have made trade policy much more transparent. You can read all about our negotiations online. We publish chapters, proposals, background materials, summaries of trade rounds."</Para><Para>But there still remains the challenge of explaining more clearly why trade is good, she said. "This is not about ticking a box. Through trade, we can help small family-owned companies, we can preserve our welfare system, we can grow and create more jobs. The EU Commission cannot sell that story. We can do our part, but companies need to do more to tell their employees and their customers about the benefits of trade.</Para><Para>"We must also address the concerns of people who feel left out by globalisation, who cannot immediately move from a job that is disappearing to doing something high-tech. It's not easy to move from a monotonous factory job to programming robots. So governments and companies must take responsibility and invest in training and lifelong learning so people feel comfortable with the changes that are happening, because they are happening very fast, and it's scary. There are also going to be a lot of new jobs that we can't imagine today. But we need to make sure people are prepared. Unfortunately, I don't think governments are prepared for the changes that are happening."</Para><Para>Finally, I asked Ms Malmstr√∂m whether being the EU's Trade Commissioner - especially at this time - is the toughest job that she has had.</Para><Para>Many of her jobs have been difficult, she said. But the most draining, emotionally, was her previous job as EU Commissioner for Home Affairs.</Para><Para>"We had some extremely difficult moments when we were trying to set up policies for the EU to receive refugees in a fair and transparent way. We were fighting sentiments such as populism and also very strong racist and xenophobic forces."</Para><Para>She had to deal with disasters too. Etched in her memory is a day on the Sicilian island of Lampedusa in October 2013. "I was standing in front of 300 coffins of people who had drowned trying to get into Europe. That was probably the worst moment of my life."</Para></TailParas><Byline fid="by" index="field">Vikram Khanna , The EU's straight-shooting trade chief </Byline><Credit fid="cr" index="field"></Credit><Contact fid="ct" index="field"></Contact><Notes fid="rf" index="field"></Notes><Art fid="art" index="field">Ms Malmstr√∂m says that her stint as a psychiatric nurse when she was a student was good preparation for the world of politics as she has met all kinds of people, and nothing surprises her. </Art><Copyright fid="cy" index="field">(c) 2018 Singapore Press Holdings Limited </Copyright></Article></ArchiveDoc><AdocTOC adoctype="article"><Item size="0" ref="distdoc:archive/ArchiveDoc::Article" type="arttext"></Item><Item size="0" ref="distdoc:archive/InvertText" type="invtext"></Item></AdocTOC></DistDoc>
