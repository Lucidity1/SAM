Normally our flight paths would not cross.</Para></LeadPara></HandL><TailParas fid="td"><Para>But with the Broadway opening on March 15 of ''Escape to Margaritaville,'' a jukebox musical of tunes Mr. Buffett composed or made famous, it became my responsibility to deliver bad news.</Para><Para>''Dopey fun is one thing,'' I wrote in my review that night, ''but 'Escape to Margaritaville,' a paean to the pleasures of zipless debauchery, is pitched so low it will temporarily extinguish your I.Q.''</Para><Para>And then the Parrotheads attacked.</Para><Para>I don't take writing pans lightly. For one thing, I'm as thin-skinned as anyone else, and don't enjoy being excoriated on Twitter or mocked as a theater snob or told on Facebook to just ''relax'' -- as if my being uptight were what made the show bad.</Para><Para>I also know how many talented people work very hard to put together even a terrible production, and how many others feel hurt on their behalf by disparaging words.</Para><Para>So when I get home from the theater with my notebook bristling with scribbles like ''what is happening?'' and ''kill me now,'' I ask myself a few questions. Was there anything at all I admired? Can I imagine why someone else might like it? Are there people I would send to the show despite my own distaste for it?</Para><Para>With ''Escape to Margaritaville'' (which I kept typing as ''Escape From Margaritaville'' while drafting my review), there was indeed one element I admired: the cast. Though it bothered me that such top-notch performers were made to do such inane things, I had to admit they did them well.</Para><Para>And, yes, I could imagine why others might like the show. Perhaps those who already felt connected to Mr. Buffett's country-calypso ditties would relish the chance to hear them in a new context. Or perhaps those who aspire to the laid-back lifestyle his alcohol-fueled empire promotes would enjoy another taste of it.</Para><Para>That insight allowed me to recommend ''Escape to Margaritaville'' heartily to two groups: Parrotheads and people sloshed enough not to care about its theatrical merits.</Para><Para>I am not, by profession or temperament, either of those things. I did bring my twentysomething nephew with me as a control subject, but although he had two margaritas, he liked the show only marginally better than I did.</Para><Para>What I couldn't control for is taste. Arts criticism is in some ways a paradox, like Marianne Moore's ''imaginary gardens with real toads in them.'' Critics try to make objective judgments based on responses they know to be subjective.</Para><Para>So when readers are stung (or just annoyed) by my pans, I remind them that fighting about theater is often the best part of the show.</Para><Para>And when they insist, ''You're wrong: I had a great time,'' I respond that I'm glad. I don't need them to agree with me.</Para><Para>But I have to agree with myself, which is why I said that it was my ''responsibility'' to pan ''Escape to Margaritaville.'' Not just because the theater needs to set a higher bar for musicals. And not just because -- let's be honest -- writing pans is invigorating. Every critic savors Oscar Wilde's observation, in ''The Importance of Being Earnest,'' that on certain occasions ''it becomes more than a moral duty to speak one's mind. It becomes a pleasure.''</Para><Para>What really makes a pan a responsibility is that criticism is a form of journalism, which is, in theory, a form of truth. A critic reports honestly on his own thoughts and feelings, as if they were a war or a trial. They often are both.</Para><Para>So when I see something as objectionable and cynical as ''Escape to Margaritaville,'' I believe I have no choice but to say so, in terms that match the size of the feeling. That other critics may feel otherwise (though in this case few did) doesn't matter, because the point is to let readers navigate by a steady aesthetic star.</Para><Para>Ideally that means more than just denunciation, even in a pan. It means providing theatrical or social context, arguing a position clearly and, yes, getting in a few zingers.</Para><Para>In that sense, ''theater snob'' isn't really an insult. It's my job description.</Para></TailParas><Byline fid="by" index="field">By JESSE GREEN </Byline><Credit fid="cr" index="field"></Credit><Contact fid="ct" index="field"></Contact><Notes fid="rf" index="field"></Notes><Art fid="art" index="field">Alison Luff, left, and Paul Alexander Nolan in the musical ''Escape to Margaritaville.''
