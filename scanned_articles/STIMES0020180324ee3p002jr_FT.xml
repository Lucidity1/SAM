fid="lp"><Para>Ditching the off-the-rack route of instant gratification in 1998 and filling my wardrobe with bespoke pieces brought me huge savings and taught me the economics of wear.</Para><Para>Years ago, more specifically 20 years back, I had my own version of the Daniel Day-Lewis movie Phantom Thread pan out in my life when I stepped, albeit tentatively, into a boutique tailor shop in Temple Street, just around the corner from Singapore's oldest Hindu temple, Sri Mariamman Temple in South Bridge Road.</Para></LeadPara></HandL><TailParas fid="td"><Para>There was an almost monastic sign just above the cash register that said: Zann and Denn. It turned out to be a bridal apparel-design shop run by a soft-spoken couple who also did bespoke clothes for a small clientele.</Para><Para>The interior was not very capacious, but neat and almost obsessively well appointed. There was a small changing room, a fitting section and a designer's sketching table with stacks of textile samples. There were several headless mannequins carved out of burnished wood with impossibly waspy waistlines that seemed to focus on my (less than waspy) girth in the weirdest way.</Para><Para>Suzanne Chua, one half of the management of this tiny atelier in Chinatown, wanted to know why I was there, before she delved into the whats and wherefores.</Para><Para>I blurted out, quite indelicately, that I just could not, for the life of me, bring myself to discard one more piece of clothing that I had bought - on impulse - from a fast-fashion outlet ever again. I had just enough of the mindless wastage since I started my first real job in 1984 at the then Straits Times Press as a sub-editor.</Para><Para>This was in 1998. You can imagine how many cast-offs, discards and pret-a-porter faux pas I had racked up (pun intended) since becoming economically active. I would buy an outfit on impulse, wear it once, hate the way it looked on me after one wash, and consign it to my "disasters" basket.</Para><Para>Suzanne whipped out her 6B Faber-Castell pencil and started sketching a few designs. At first, I thought I would take the lead in how my clothes should look by borrowing her sketchpen and doodling some silhouettes for her - just so that she would have a clearer picture.</Para><Para>After all, being a newspaper designer with an Award of Excellence from the United States Society of Newspaper Design (1989), who revamped the former RTV Times into the 8 Days magazine (1991) and who worked on the design of the logo for the Singapore Indian Development Association (1990) - I should have found it a cinch.</Para><Para>I was woefully mistaken.</Para><Para>Suzanne's sketches were crisp, shorn of extraneous detail and spartan - but captured the essence of the design. They were not the gross, superfluous ink blobs that I had rendered.</Para><Para>After just 15 minutes, I was ready to invest time and a modest amount on a tailor-made blouse that would take around three weeks to be stitched together and cost almost double what I could get at the stores. But I decided right there and then that I would go cold turkey - and just wait.</Para><Para>That first step has led me on a whimsical, eye-opening and sometimes humbling journey into the economics behind the making of a piece of clothing that I cannot bring myself to discard.</Para><Para>The wait time of three weeks taught me discipline. What I could buy for maybe $60 in a store, I had to pay almost $128 for now at my tailor's, and that forced me to stop doling out moolah at stores while waiting. When it came to the fitting session, there were still little nips and tucks that had to be done, and a further wait.</Para><Para>But when the final product was draped on, it was all worth it. The feel, the fit, the colours, the proportions - everything was aesthetically well executed.</Para><Para>Now, that relationship with my tailor has resulted in a well curated wardrobe that I can count on for any occasion - be it a formal dress-up dinner, a meeting with the bosses or daily workwear.</Para><Para>And the upshot of all this?</Para><Para>I have stopped buying clothes on impulse. I have a better understanding of textiles that suit a certain design and embellishments like buttons and cuffs that can add interest to an older piece of clothing to repurpose it. And most importantly, where I would have easily spent about $300 on clothes at one visit to a fast-fashion store, I now save about 40 per cent each time I make a blouse, skirt or dress at my tailor's.</Para><Para>With the recent lure of online shopping, I have built up enough discipline to say "no" to even the most mouth-watering sale items from Net-a-Porter or any of the proliferation of sites begging the hapless shopper to part with hard-earned cash.</Para><Para>In fact, so pervasive is the marketing of online fast fashion today that Suzanne even tells me that she spends a considerable amount of time unpicking, repurposing and altering clothes that walk-in customers to her new location in Kreta Ayer Road bought online.</Para><Para>While they complain about her charges for alterations, she holds firm, as she insists that every piece of clothing needs time to re-fashion, and that hers is not a mass-producing sweatshop.</Para><Para>Some customers storm out, but most see the light and agree to wait for a few weeks to come back for a proper fitting - after a thorough chastising by Suzanne on the finer points of overlocking stitches, roll hemming, satin binding and piping, properly done concealed zipping, and old-school but sturdy hand-stitching.</Para><Para>Clothing waste, like food waste, is increasing by the year, and peaks around periods such as Chinese New Year and Christmas, when spring cleaning is done.</Para><Para>While the average shopper thinks she is detoxing her wardrobe, she is actually adding to almost 10 tonnes of cast-off clothing per day (that can go up to 30 tonnes a day) that the Salvation Army in Singapore said last year is being dumped at their thrift stores. It says three in five donated items are pieces of clothing.</Para><Para>What's worse is that the racks that line the aisles of the charity organisation's five thrift stores even feature brand-new clothes and items with price tags still attached.</Para><Para>Singapore's National Environment Agency in 2015 released statistics that showed that Singapore generated 156,700 tonnes of textile and leather waste.</Para><Para>This includes used clothing, linen and bags. Only 12,500 tonnes or 8 per cent could be recycled, with those not separated at source for recycling or reuse finding their way to the incinerators.</Para><Para>For my part, I'm still trying to draw like Suzanne, with the 6B Faber-Castell pencil I stole from her shop ages ago. She can prise it from my cold, dead fingers.</Para></TailParas><Byline fid="by" index="field">Chantal Sajan </Byline><Credit fid="cr" index="field"></Credit><Contact fid="ct" index="field"></Contact><Notes fid="rf" index="field"></Notes><Art fid="art" index="field"></Art><Copyright fid="cy" index="field">(c) 2018 Singapore Press Holdings Limited </Copyright></Article></ArchiveDoc><AdocTOC adoctype="article"><Item size="0" ref="distdoc:archive/ArchiveDoc::Article" type="arttext"></Item><Item size="0" ref="distdoc:archive/InvertText" type="invtext"></Item></AdocTOC></DistDoc>
