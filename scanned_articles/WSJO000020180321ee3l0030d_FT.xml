Kinder fans rushed to stores when the treat went on sale in the U.S.—only to get an unwelcome surprise</Para></Headline></Title><LeadPara fid="lp"><Para>In recent weeks, a frenzy of social-media buzz whipped Ashley Andersen into a state of jubilation. A chocolate egg containing a toy, long outlawed in the U.S., had finally been decriminalized.</Para><Para>The 27-year-old Oklahoma City native grew up enjoying the treat, known as Kinder Surprise, during trips to Denmark to visit family. U.S. authorities had long ago banned the hollow chocolate egg, because of an 80-year-old act forbidding food from containing nonedible items.</Para></LeadPara></HandL><TailParas fid="td"><Para>As word of the egg's supposed liberation spread by tweet and post, Ms. Andersen and many other American fans looked forward to stocking up. Their excitement didn't last long. The Kinder sweet on sale stateside was a pretender—hollow and toy-containing, yes, but unlike its beloved original in nearly every other way.</Para><Para>For starters, the egg is made of plastic, not chocolate. It also has a different name: Kinder Joy. When cracked open, the Joy splits into two separately sealed halves, one containing the toy, the other holding a swirl of edible cream, two chocolate wafer balls and a small plastic spoon.</Para><Para>"That's not a Kinder egg!" Ms. Andersen recalled thinking. "It was kind of a letdown."</Para><Para>Both eggs are produced by Italian confectioner Ferrero International SA, maker of a number of well-known treats including Nutella chocolate spread. The company said it developed the Kinder Joy in 2001 as a warm-weather alternative to the quick-to-melt Kinder Surprise, which was first sold in the 1970s. Ferrero eventually rolled out the Joy beyond warm-weather climates, including, just a few months ago, the U.S., where it doesn't face the same legal problems as its cousin.</Para><Para>Ferrero's U.S. marketing campaign for the Kinder Joy, including a television ad during the Oscars, clearly stated the product had a different name and a plastic egg. The company said the Kinder Joy has been "extraordinarily successful" world-wide, and has received "the same positive response from retailers and consumers here in the U.S."</Para><Para>To many Kinder Surprise enthusiasts, the alternative egg serves as a painful reminder that the product they love is still out of reach.</Para><Para>Leslie Dannelly, a Florida mother of four who runs <ELink type="webpage" ref="https://freetheegg.wordpress.com/">"Free the Egg," a blog dedicated to getting the Kinder Surprise legalized</ELink>, said that since December she has been bombarded with messages from people congratulating her on achieving her mission.</Para><Para>"It was like, great job! Looks like the egg is legalized now," she said of the messages. She wrote a post to set the record straight.</Para><Para>Ms. Dannelly, 45, grew up with Kinder eggs, thanks to her French mother and a military father who took the family along on a posting to Germany. When she moved back to the U.S. and had children of her own, Ms. Dannelly was shocked to learn of the ban.</Para><Para>She launched Free the Egg in 2011 and <ELink type="webpage" ref="https://www.change.org/p/cpsc-remove-the-ban-on-the-ferrero-kinder-surprise-egg">created a petition to legalize the Kinder Surprise</ELink>, which she said would be sent to all members of Congress and federal officials once it gets the required 10,000 signatures.</Para><Para>"I've had people tell me, it's so silly that you're even doing this—and it is really silly," she said. "But it's such a silly ban."</Para><Para>The Kinder Surprise runs afoul of a 1938 act forbidding food from containing nonnutritive objects—a statute enforced by the Food and Drug Administration. Additionally, the toys inside the eggs, which sometimes require assembly, can include parts small enough to constitute a choking hazard for children under 3, the Consumer Product Safety Commission said.</Para><Para>The commission said it considers chocolate eggs "to be children's products. This means they must meet federal safety standards for children's products."</Para><Para>The CPSC has vigorously enforced the ban. In a 2006 alert, the agency said it was "aware of reports" that some retailers were selling the eggs in the run-up to Easter. It instructed retailers to remove the contraband sweets from store shelves, and consumers to "immediately take them away from young children."</Para><Para>Ferrero said the Kinder Joy eggs "are fully compliant with both FDA and CPSC regulations."</Para><Para>The Kinder Surprise isn't the only European confection to run afoul of U.S. regulations for harboring a nonedible item. The galette des rois, a traditional French cake containing plastic or ceramic trinkets, falls into the same category as the Kinder Surprise, the FDA said in 2015, <ELink type="webpage" ref="https://www.wsj.com/articles/the-surprise-in-your-king-cake-might-be-no-prize-at-all-1420414798">though the agency added it hadn't taken any enforcement action on the matter</ELink>.</Para><Para>Lisa Munro, a 38-year-old from Grand Rapids, Mich., wasn't impressed when she tried her first Kinder Joy in November. "I shouldn't be so hard on it," she said. "I just was expecting the chocolate egg."</Para><Para>She said she loves the Kinder Surprise's shell—made of a layer of milk chocolate encasing a layer of white chocolate, which she ate often as a child growing up in Michigan, near the Canadian border.</Para><Para>Some toy-containing chocolate eggs pass U.S. regulatory muster. Choco Treasure, a product made by New Jersey-based Candy Treasure LLC, has been available nationwide since 2013. CEO Kevin Gass said the company worked closely with regulators to make sure the egg and its toys would meet all requirements. The product is made up of a toy-containing plastic egg that is almost, but not completely, coated in chocolate—making it clear to consumers that there is a nonedible object inside.</Para><Para>Ferrero said it never sought to market the Kinder Surprise in the U.S., meaning any such eggs found on sale have been imported by a third party.</Para><Para>Economy Candy, a store in New York's Lower East Side, used to sell "a ton" of Kinder Surprise eggs, said third-generation owner Mitchell Cohen. "Nobody really knew they weren't supposed to be sold," he said. Then in 2011, a week after a story about Kinder Surprise eggs in New York ran in local media, the store got a visit from Agriculture Department officials, he said. Economy Candy stopped selling it.</Para><Para>"Around that same time," Mr. Cohen recalled, "people started coming in off the street trying to sell us a box of Kinder eggs like they were smuggled diamonds." In all instances, he said, "We've sent them on their way."</Para><Para>U.S. Customs and Border Protection said it seized over 160,000 Kinder Surprise eggs from travelers' baggage and from international mail shipments in the past seven years.</Para><Para>Caroline Liebenow, an electronics assembler from Nashua, N.H., says she knows one store, which she'd rather not name, where Kinder Surprise eggs can still be found. She said a recent discussion with store employees, about when the eggs would be back in stock, felt awkward due to the product's illegality.</Para><Para>"I'm not sure if they knew that we knew," she said.</Para><Para>Ms. Liebenow, 42, said she discovered Kinder Surprise eggs while living in Finland over a decade ago. She said she has no plans to try the Kinder Joy.</Para><Para>"In a way, it would be like saying that I accept this ban," she said.</Para><Para>Write to David Marcelis at <ELink type="webpage" ref="mailto:david.marcelis@wsj.com">david.marcelis@wsj.com</ELink></Para><Para><ELink type="webpage" ref="https://www.wsj.com/news/types/a-hed">Take a Look at Other Recent A-Heds</ELink></Para><Para>* <ELink type="webpage" ref="https://www.wsj.com/articles/whats-that-thing-youre-sending-an-email-with-um-its-a-blackberry-1521215499">What's That Thing You're Sending an Email With?
