enthusiasts are snapping up lemon trees from Singapore nurseries at prices ranging from $20 to more than $200 a pot</Para><Para>Life gave civil servant Janny Cheong lemons - and she made lemonade.</Para></LeadPara></HandL><TailParas fid="td"><Para>The 49-year-old picked up gardening when she was recovering from breast cancer and says she looks forward to harvesting the fruit of her labour.</Para><Para>After spending four years tending to the two potted plants in the balcony garden of her 16th-floor condominium, the nearly five-year-old plants now have 17 lemons each in different sizes - the smallest of which is less than half a centimetre long.</Para><Para>"I've not tasted the lemons yet. They are still green," says Madam Cheong, who adds that the plants were presents from her sister-in-law, who grew them from seeds from store-bought Lisbon and Meyer lemons.</Para><Para>"The baby fruit just drop and drop and drop," she says, adding that there was an 8cm-long fruit that fell off the plant because of the wind. "Only the strongest will survive - to me, they are very resilient."</Para><Para>She is not the only lemon plant enthusiast in town.</Para><Para>More than five nurseries and garden centres here say they have seen more interest from the public in their lemon plants in recent years.</Para><Para>Madam Janny Cheong has two potted lemon plants in the balcony garden of her condominium. ST PHOTO: KHALID BABA</Para><Para>The sun-loving plants, which grow in tropical and subtropical climates and thrive in Singapore, cost anywhere from $20 to more than $200 a pot, depending on the size. They are generally sold as potted specimens in shrub form or as a standard, a topiary trained to look like a lollipop, says Dr Wilson Wong, deputy director of horticulture at the Singapore Botanic Gardens.</Para><Para>Lemon plant-growing is becoming more common here possibly, he says, due to greater interest in edible gardening by Singaporeans, who want more control over the food they eat - or just as a hobby.</Para><Para>Many local gardeners who grow edibles, he says, are drawn to the "novelty" of being able to grow subtropical and temperate plants not commonly seen in the tropics.</Para><Para>Local nurseries also play a part as they import such plants and make them available here, he adds.</Para><Para>Dr Wong says plants sold in nurseries are usually mature ones that are often already flowering and fruiting - getting fruit from them would be much faster compared with plants grown from seeds.</Para><Para>Lai Seng Florist in Bedok has seen a 20 to 30 per cent increase in the number of people interested in buying its 0.9m-tall Meyer lemon plants, grown in Singapore and Malaysia and priced at $20 a pot.</Para><Para>A spokesman attributes this increase to people spreading the word on platforms such as social media - for example, The Urban Farmers (Singapore) group on Facebook, which has more than 21,800 members.</Para><Para>Mr James Koh, 66, founder of Hawaii Landscape in Thomson Road, says that over the past six months, there has been an 80 per cent spike in the number of people buying these plants.</Para><Para>His company has been selling lemon plants since the 1950s. These range in height from 0.6 to 2.2m and cost between $68 and $238.</Para><Para>"During the Chinese New Year period, more people saw the lemon plants and they took photographs of them."</Para><Para>Candy Floriculture sells lemon plants imported from Malaysia, Thailand, China and Taiwan. The price varies between $18 and $250 a pot, depending on the size.</Para><Para>Meanwhile, Far East Flora says the increasing appeal could be due to more interest in growing tropical fruit and the "educational" appeal to groups such as children.</Para><Para>Asked what varieties of lemon thrive in Singapore and how many varieties there are here, Dr Wong says that because lemon plants sold here tend not to be labelled with their cultivar names, it is difficult to understand plant performance and growth requirements.</Para><Para>He says: "It would be a good idea for nurseries to start introducing named cultivars of lemons, so growers can have a better idea of the growth characteristics and requirements."</Para><Para>Lemon plant enthusiast Naomi Toh, 39, who lives in a terrace house, harvested one lemon from her plant shortly after buying it and used it for a honey lemon drink.</Para><Para>Like several others interviewed by The Sunday Times, she says the lemons grown here have the same tangy taste as imported ones.</Para><Para>The housewife and mother of two children aged eight and four, who bought the 1.8m-tall plant for $120 from the Spa Flora garden centre in Bedok before Chinese New Year, says: "In Singapore, we don't have many opportunities to see many fruit trees. I love nature and would like to expose my kids to how different fruit trees look like."</Para><Para>She adds: "I don't have caterpillar issues as many birds such as sunbirds and mynahs visit my garden and help to eat them. Bats from my neighbour's house fertilise the plant every night... occasionally, I will add some bone meal to the soil."</Para><Para>Housewife Charlotte Dawson, 42, has a lemon plant in her balcony on the 15th floor of her condominium.</Para><Para>The American, who bought the plant from Far East Flora in December for $75, says: "We chose it because it already had two lemons on it. They were green and we just had to wait for them to ripen."</Para><Para>The plant now has 12 lemons in various stages of growth. The family plans to use them for shrimp scampi, Mexican food, and gin and tonic. They have already harvested one lemon so far and it gave their shrimp pasta "the expected lemon tanginess".</Para><Para>"We are looking forward to the next one to finish ripening - the goal is to use it in cocktails," says Mrs Dawson, who uses neem oil to keep leaf-eating insects at bay.</Para><Para>Ms Hilary White, 55, bought a lemon plant from Chye Heng Orchid Garden in Bah Soon Pah Road in October.</Para><Para>She says of the plant, which cost $50 and is being grown in a large pot: "Within a week, it had all these beautiful flowers... I thought I was getting a lime tree, then (the fruit) started to turn yellow."</Para><Para>The vegetarian, who does a lot of Mediterranean cooking, hopes to use the juice in hummus and salads.</Para><Para>The housewife, who is a volunteer at the National Museum of Singapore, has harvested two fruit so far and used them in gin and tonic.</Para><Para>Of course, the lemons help brighten up her home too. "They are beautiful. They are the sunshine of my life."</Para></TailParas><Byline fid="by" index="field">Toh Wen Li </Byline><Credit fid="cr" index="field"></Credit><Contact fid="ct" index="field"></Contact><Notes fid="rf" index="field"></Notes><Art fid="art" index="field">Mr James Koh of Hawaii Landscape, which has been selling lemon plants since the 1950s, says there has been an 80 per cent spike in the number of people buying lemon plants over the past six months. </Art><Copyright fid="cy" index="field">(c) 2018 Singapore Press Holdings Limited </Copyright></Article></ArchiveDoc><AdocTOC adoctype="article"><Item size="0" ref="distdoc:archive/ArchiveDoc::Article" type="arttext"></Item><Item size="0" ref="distdoc:archive/InvertText" type="invtext"></Item></AdocTOC></DistDoc>
