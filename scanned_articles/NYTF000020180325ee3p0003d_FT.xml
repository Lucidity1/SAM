fid="lp"><Para>The novelist Mary Gordon, known for books like 1981's ''The Company of Women,'' about a girl who escapes her sheltered upbringing to embrace rebellion in 1960s America, considers her lifelong admiration of British actor-politician Glenda Jackson a ''romance.'' Gordon was 16 when she first saw Jackson onstage, in the 1965 Broadway production of ''Marat/Sade,'' a philosophical investigation of the meaning of protest set during and after the French Revolution. In the '70s, Gordon, now 68, graduated from college to a life in letters, and she memorized lines from ''Sunday Bloody Sunday,'' a 1971 film directed by John Schlesinger and starring Jackson as Alex, a woman competing with a doctor, played by Peter Finch, for the love of a young male sculptor and coming to terms with free love.</Para></LeadPara></HandL><TailParas fid="td"><Para> As Gordon's novels and nonfiction -- including an important 1978 essay on abortion rights published in the New York Review of Books -- won her increasing acclaim, she watched Jackson, now a two-time Oscar winner, make a turn to a surprising second career as a liberal member of Parliament beginning in 1992. Finally, and just as surprisingly, Jackson returned to acting. Just after turning 80 two years ago, she won raves in London as a gender-blind King Lear. This spring brings Jackson back to Broadway, starring in the revival of Edward Albee's 1991 play ''Three Tall Women,'' which opens March 29, about a woman recalling her life's great triumphs and regrets. One morning in January in Manhattan, Gordon finally met her idol for a long conversation, which covered poetry, film and theater, but most significantly the state of feminism today.</Para><Para>MARY GORDON: My life was based on you during the '70s, but the first time I saw you, I sneaked out of my house to see ''Marat/Sade.'' I knew that if I was going to be the kind of person I wanted to be, I had to go see it. And it's still deeply disturbing.</Para><Para>GLENDA JACKSON: It doesn't have that effect on me at all. As a play to be in, it was extraordinary. We'd played it in London to totally silent audiences, but in New York, they applauded the songs; they shouted, ''Encore!''</Para><Para>MG: Yes, I remember it. Do you see a through line from that to your interpretation of Lear? Both touch on madness.</Para><Para>GJ: Well, when I worked with Peter Brook it was like coming across an oasis in the desert. Like all great directors, he creates the kind of world in which everyone's responsible for the whole play. That sense of the total being greater than the sum of the parts is very, very strong in ''Lear.'' Now, I wasn't interested in the gender-bender aspect, but what I did find interesting is how age begins to fracture those absolutes which tell you what women are and what men are.</Para><Para>MG: ''Sunday Bloody Sunday'' is one of my favorite movies in the world. Why do you think it hasn't been shown more often?</Para><Para>GJ: I don't honestly know. The studio was enormously shocked by it because they were thinking it was going to be another ''Midnight Cowboy.'' And they didn't know how to sell it.</Para><Para>MG: It doesn't date a bit, even though it's a pre-AIDS movie.</Para><Para>GJ: It's not really about sex, is it? It's about love -- about the capacity to love both genders.</Para><Para>MG: How would you define yourself as an actor in the British tradition?</Para><Para>GJ: I benefited from that huge change in British theater otherwise known as [playwright] John Osborne. When I left drama school, the director said to me, ''Don't expect to work much before you're 40, because you're essentially a character actress.'' And that was a very accurate assessment, because the British theater then was still essentially a middle-class world. Then Osborne wrote ''Look Back in Anger'' (1956), and the whole thing just exploded.</Para><Para>MG: I saw ''Stevie'' (1977) in the West End in London [starring Jackson as British poet Stevie Smith]. I adore her work, and she is just tough as an old boot. Funny, but looks at the darkest things. As Emily Dickinson said, ''Tell the truth but tell it slant.''</Para><Para>GJ: I'm so pleased you said that, because I'm a big fan of Emily Dickinson. The view of both Stevie and Emily Dickinson seems to be that here were these two solitary, depressed, lonely women, but they lived in these fantastic worlds!</Para><Para>MG: They're great, greater than anybody around at that time. But their forms are small. And so, female gets defined as minor. Some of American women writers' best work was done in the form of the short story: Flannery O'Connor, Eudora Welty, Katherine Anne Porter, Jean Stafford. I think what's funny is around the same time that Emily Dickinson wrote, ''I'm nobody! Who are you?'' Whitman wrote, ''I am large, I contain multitudes.''</Para><Para>GJ: [Laughs] Well, we had a program, years I'm going back now. This woman went back to Oxford to speak at her college. There'd been a big upsurge in women going to university, but it was very rare that a woman had a first-class degree. So she asked her old professor why, and this professor -- also a woman -- said because their examiners are still in the main men, and they like a lot of flash and filigree, whereas women go to endless lengths of attribution and details.</Para><Para>MG: I teach at a women's college, Barnard, across the street from Columbia, which used to be male for donkey's years, and I say to my students, ''Do not speak into your collar when you tell me your name. There are men across the street saying things of immense stupidity at the top of their lungs!''</Para><Para>GJ: When I was in Parliament we had meetings of schoolchildren, and the girls almost invariably were at the back of the hall. Every single meeting at some point I would say, ''Is there no girl who has a question?''</Para><Para>MG: But you can't win for losing, because if you do open your mouth --</Para><Para>GJ: You're a ball-buster.</Para><Para>MG: Men can write the most disgusting things about women's bodies and that's considered fine. I wrote a line in my first book, which was, ''He played with her breast as if he were making a meatball.'' And the male critics said, ''She obviously hates men.'' It's very hard to say, ''Well, I'm going to say what I have to say.'' You have to get a little older for that.</Para><Para>GJ: Quite right. And I still find it astounding that male creative writers don't find us that interesting. We're hardly if ever the dramatic engine -- although in ''Three Tall Women'' we are. There was a period where I was doing films where the female character was there to prove the hero wasn't gay. It's just bizarre.</Para><Para>MG: And look at what happened to Hillary Clinton. But it seems to me you had a moral imperative for going into politics. You wanted to change something.</Para><Para>GJ: Certainly anything I could have done that was legal to get rid of Margaret Thatcher -- she said there is no such thing as a society, and it made me so furious I walked into my French windows and nearly broke my nose.</Para><Para>MG: One of the things I find hard since the election of Trump is to believe that my work matters at all. That 44 percent of college-educated people voted for this person who made fun of disabled people and talked about grabbing pussy -- it fills me with such despair that it makes me feel that my work is just filigree on the rotting body of a corpse.</Para><Para>GJ: Oh no, come on, America isn't a rotting body, and you can't ever define influence in that way. Something you write may touch someone in such a way that they go on to do something transformative.</Para><Para>MG: So you don't feel despair at Brexit and Trump?</Para><Para>GJ: Certainly, that my country voted to come out of the European Union I regard as insanity.</Para><Para>MG: So is that why you've moved on to ''Lear'' and ''Three Tall Women'' -- because the other problems seem so intractable?</Para><Para>GJ: No, I don't think so. We've been in worse situations. I'm probably optimistic. If I'm not optimistic I'm nihilistic, and I'm certainly not nihilistic. I was raised by women during the war, when the men were all away fighting for us. They dealt with what life delivered with no small grace and a great deal of humor.</Para><Para>MG: I was raised by women too. My mother had polio at the age of 3, was the oldest of nine. My grandmother may have had a third-grade education, but she was brilliant -- tough, not warm and fuzzy. But when she died all nine children fell apart, including my mother, who ended up an alcoholic with Alzheimer's. So it worked for a while and then life became too hard.</Para><Para>GJ: But you're here. You're here! This is the thing isn't it?</Para><Para>MG: I am. And I wouldn't have a career if it weren't for the women's movement.</Para><Para>GJ: Right, so how can you be despairing? The women's movement came about through women who hadn't had a women's movement. However bleak and awful it may be, there will be opportunities for people to move forward in a different way, a better way.</Para><Para>MG: I hope so. My students are marvelous, and my daughter's wonderful. But with #MeToo ... while I think it's great that suddenly people have woken up to the crap that women have had to put up with, it's a little bit unnuanced for my taste.</Para><Para>GJ: Well, the Weinstein thing is really not about the women's movement. In my country two women die every week at the hands of their partner, usually male, and that is not a front-page story.</Para><Para>MG: I don't want to be critical because they'll make their own way and God bless them, but the focus on date rape and gender identity, at a time when women can't get access to abortion -- I find it a kind of privatistic focus. I had this talk with my students. I was teaching this story by Mary McCarthy called ''The Man in the Brooks Brothers Shirt.'' And I said, ''Look, I'm 150 years old, but my generation, we didn't want to be looked at as sex objects. You all go out wearing shirts cut down to your navels and skirts up to your nose. Why does that feel good to you?'' They said, ''It's fun, we get to do it and it's men's problem.'' And I said, ''O.K., just make sure you don't drink.''</Para><Para>GJ: It's a somewhat careless attitude. Sometimes they choose the wrong battles. You have to choose the battles that are actually going to -- win, lose or draw -- make some kind of step forward.</Para><Para>MG: I do think that maybe a new generation of men has to learn it's not O.K. But to go back to Alex's line in ''Sunday Bloody Sunday,'' which I went around saying as much as I possibly could in 1971: ''I've had this business: Anything is better than nothing.
