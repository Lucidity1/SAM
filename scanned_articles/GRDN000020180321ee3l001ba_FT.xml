Her is an extract from a recent article he wrote f <ELink type="webpage" ref="https://www.ft.com/content/f15975be-073a-11e8-9e12-af73e8db3c71">or the Financial Times (paywall) </ELink> on the subject.</Para><Para>One solution would be to tie an NHS tax to the electoral cycle. In advance of an election, the OBR could provide an informed estimate of the funding necessary to deliver a broadly unchanged service over the next five years. Political parties could then set out their proposals for the next parliament along with the rate of tax necessary to fund it. The five-year plans would then be enacted in the first budget of the new parliament.</Para><Para>Because the tax would be incremental (the current level of health spending would continue to be funded out of general taxation), its rate would not need to be high. The precise form should be a matter for debate. But income-related national insurance provides a good model, subject to two small changes. To preserve intergenerational fairness, the old should pay alongside those of working age, and it should be payable on all income not just earnings. In my view a tax of 2 per cent would have closed the funding gap for this parliament.</Para><Para>Critics will argue that an NHS tax is at best a presentational wheeze and at worst a fiddle. The Treasury would still be standing behind the system as a whole, and could no doubt find ways of diverting funds from the intended cause. But the OBR and the link to the electoral cycle would allow voters to hold the government to account. If an NHS tax reconnected taxpayers with the services they pay for, that would be a positive step. And if it ensured more spending was financed from tax rather than borrowing, that could only improve the soundness of the public finances.

(He wasn’t, but her answer amounted to a tacit admission that it was the Tory performance locally that was to blame.) After that Corbyn also deployed an array of quotes from Tory council leaders about council underfunding quite effectively (partly because the rift between the Conservatives in national government and in local government on the subject of council budgets is one of the under-reported stories in British politics). But Corbyn’s PMQs second half was not as bold as his opening, and May mounted a spirited, and largely successful, fightback. The attack on putative Labour tax rises was a bit speculative, but her jibes about the centrist Labour council leaders being ousted by Momentum activists was effective (at least in the Commons, where self-interest means Labour MPs follow these stories especially closely) and her reference to the two defecting Labour councillors towards the end was a cheap but easy hit.

Here is an extract:</Para><Para><ELink type="webpage" ref="https://www.theguardian.com/environment/fishing">Fishing</ELink> quotas, by limiting the amount of catch, have worked as intended and have brought many fish populations in EU waters back to sustainable levels. The recent certification of North Sea cod as sustainable was a particularly hard-fought journey from a near collapse of the stocks. The value of fish landings is now increasing year-on-year, and profits in the fishing industry are at the highest level recorded.</Para><Para>And yet it is difficult to find signs of these positive trends in many fishing communities. This is partly due to changes in technology and labour markets, resulting in fewer fishing vessels each year (as in other EU and non-EU countries). But it’s also related to how the UK distributes its quota, and not just its total size. The decision on how quota should be distributed (big vessel or small, trawler or handline) has always been up to the UK government. The reality is that most Brexiteers have never engaged with the nuts and bolts of this issue, and we’re looking at two more years without real engagement.</Para><Para>And here is his article in full.</Para><Para>Related: <ELink type="webpage" ref="https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2018/mar/21/jacob-rees-mogg-fishing-communities-hard-brexit">Rees-Mogg’s hard Brexit won’t do anything for fishing communities | Griffin Carpenter</ELink></Para><Para>block-time published-time 11.41am GMT</Para><Para>In an interview with BBC Radio 5 Live Liz Truss, the chief secretary to the Treasury, effectively confirmed that <ELink type="webpage" ref="https://www.theguardian.com/society/2018/mar/21/ministers-drop-demand-that-nhs-staff-give-up-days-leave-for-pay-rise"> a new pay deal for NHS staff </ELink> worth on average 6.5% over three years has been agreed.

Until now Tory Brexiters have been very reluctant to threaten publicly to vote against the final Brexit deal (the withdrawal agreement deal, due in the autumn - the trade deal will come much later). <ELink type="webpage" ref="https://www.theguardian.com/politics/blog/live/2017/nov/21/former-brexit-minister-urges-may-to-abandon-talks-with-eu-and-prepare-for-no-deal-politics-live?page=with:block-5a14023760526906e8cba822#block-5a14023760526906e8cba822">Andrew Bridgen vaguely threatened to vote against it a few months ago,</ELink> because he is unhappy about the “Brexit bill”, but that was a freelance operation.

Why? One factor might be that the government is now explicitly saying that, if it loses the vote on the withdrawal agreement in the autumn, it will just go ahead and leave the EU without a deal anyway. This has always been implicit, but, <ELink type="webpage" ref="https://www.huffingtonpost.co.uk/entry/brexit-minister-lord-callanan-warns-uk-will-quit-eu-without-a-deal-if-parliament-rejects-mays-brussels-plan_uk_5ab0e52ce4b0e862383b3643">as HuffPost reports,</ELink> in the Lords on Monday the Brexit minister Lord Callanan made this explicit.

To defeat the government, the Tory 13 would have to line up with the opposition. Labour has talked about voting down the withdrawal agreement deal on the basis that such a vote could force the government to go back to Brussels to try for something better. But if it were clear that that renegotiation would never happen, and that such a vote would just lead to a hard Brexit, Labour MPs could well think twice about voting down the deal.

I won’t post the whole thing, because it is long. It is presented as a letter from coastal MPs to May, and it seems to have been coordinated by the European Research Group (ERG) , the 60-strong group of Tory MPs pushing for a hard Brexit, although it is not officially from them.</Para><Para>The lead signatory is R oss Thomson, the Conservative MP for Aberdeen South. The other 12 Tories who have signed it are: Sir David Amess, Sir Henry Bellingham, Colin Clark, Steve Double, Richard Drax, Alister Jack, Bernard Jenkin, Craig Mackinlay, Sheryl Murray, Derek Thomas, Martin Vickers and Jacob Rees-Mogg, the chair of the ERG. It has also been signed by Sammy Wilson, the DUP’s Brexit spokesman.</Para><Para>Here are the main points they make.</Para><Para>* They threaten to vote against the transition deal agreed in Brussels on Monday, saying it would be “rejected” by the Commons because it effectively keeps the UK in the common fisheries policy until the end of 2020.</Para><Para>The commission’s draft withdrawal agreement envisages that the UK will remain in the CFP during the implementation period but with no say over EU policy or annual quotas. The effect of ending discards during this period without compensating measures will be a further disaster for the UK’s already shattered fishing fleet, particularly for the inshore fleet, further eroding prosperity in vulnerable coastal communities. These demands are completely unacceptable and would be rejected by the House of Commons.</Para><Para>Actually, Labour were broadly supportive of the transition deal, and so there is no reason to believe that the transition deal on its own would be rejected by the Commons. But MPs won’t get a separate vote on the transition deal. It will be packaged up with the withdrawal deal, which is due to be voted on by parliament in the autumn. Labour has not yet said how it will vote on this (which is reasonable, because no one knows what will be in the final deal), but many Tories think the opposition will find a reason to vote against. If 14 MPs (or 23, if Wilson’s nine DUP colleagues were to join him) were to vote against with all the opposition parties, May would lose.</Para><Para>* They say the UK should leave the CFP during the transition. They spell out some particular demands for May ahead of this EU summit starting tomorrow.</Para><Para>At the forthcoming EU Council, the UK should indicate:</Para><Para>Our intention to take back control of our 200 nautical mile Exclusive Economic Zone as permitted under Article 61 of the United Nations Convention on the Law of the Sea.</Para><Para>UK national fisheries resources are not negotiable.</Para><Para>Leaving the European Union means setting our own fisheries policy from 29 March 2019. The UK will not remain party to the CFP during the proposed implementation period.</Para><Para>* They say they are not opposed to the UK giving EU fishermen some access to UK waters after Brexit. But they say EU fishermen should be obliged to land their catch at UK ports.</Para><Para>Like other North Atlantic maritime states and depending on state of the marine environment and fish stocks, we should negotiate reciprocal access to non-UK vessels. But any access granted must be temporary and without future obligation. Foreign vessels granted licences to catch fish in UK waters after 29 March [2019] must comply with UKFP regulation and inspection, enforceable under UK law. They must also land their fish at UK ports for processing and onward sale.</Para><Para>The insistence that EU fishermen should land all their fish at UK ports would be almost certainly unacceptable to the EU. The EU wants to maintain existing reciprocal access for its fishermen to UK waters after Brexit. <ELink type="webpage" ref="https://www.theguardian.com/politics/blog/live/2018/mar/08/brexit-rudd-says-uk-keeping-cool-head-as-it-plans-response-to-nerve-agent-attack-on-russian-spy-politics-live?page=with:block-5aa108b6e4b0ad9b23550dec#block-5aa108b6e4b0ad9b23550dec">The UK is offering them some reciprocal access. </ELink> Quite what they get will be decided in the trade negotiation.</Para><Para>* They say the EU has been a “calamity” for the fishing industry.</Para><Para>For the UK’s fishing industry, joining the EEC was a calamity. The resultant decline in the industry accelerated the economic and social decline in coastal communities and was disastrous for conservation and the marine environment. This cannot be compounded by compromise, as the UK leaves the EU.</Para><Para>Over the period of our membership, the UK catch declined from over 1.1 million tonnes a year to 700,000. Under the Common Fisheries Policy (CFP), EU vessels now catch 650,000 tons of fish in UK waters while UK vessels catch only 90,000 tons in non-UK EU waters in return. As a result, the UK is a net importer of fish each year, with a fish deficit of 300,000 tonnes. This bleak picture however underplays the decline in the UK fishing fleet as many of the UK vessels are under foreign economic ownership and land their fish abroad – only 446,000 tones was actually landed in the UK.</Para><Para>This analysis is in line with the UK government’s own assessment of the impact joining the EEC had on the fishing industry. In 2000 the Foreign Office published its own official history of the process leading up to Britain joining the EEC, written by Sir Con O’Neill, the official who led the accession talks. Here is an extract from <ELink type="webpage" ref="https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/uknews/1354384/Britain-was-ready-to-pay-any-price-to-join-EEC.html"> what he wrote:</ELink></Para><Para>Sea fisheries remain the only significant economic activity of developed countries which are a form not of harvesting or of processing, but of hunting.

This morning the campaigners have released a joint letter to Theresa May signed by 13 Conservative MPs and one DUP MP (Sammy Wilson, the party’s Brexit spokesman) saying she should reject the transition deal agreed on Monday because it would keep the UK in the common fisheries policy (CFP) until the end of 2020. The MPs don’t explicitly say they would vote against the deal, which will be part of the final withdrawal agreement that ministers plan to put to a vote in the Commons at the end of the year.
