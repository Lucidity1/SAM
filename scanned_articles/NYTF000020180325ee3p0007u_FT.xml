Pointing at Neil Armstrong, she told her mother that this was what she wanted to do. Even before then, she stared up at the stars in the night sky near her home in the Paris suburbs and knew that questions were there waiting for her.</Para></LeadPara></HandL><TailParas fid="td"><Para>Cabrol is an explorer, an astrobiologist and a planetary geologist specializing in Mars. She is the director of the Carl Sagan Center at the SETI Institute, the nonprofit organization based in Mountain View, Calif., that seeks to explore, understand and explain the origin of life in the universe. Its work has the glamour of science fiction, but it involves rigorous research and, as Cabrol told me, ''people who are passionate enough that they can put themselves into dire straits.'' That is what she does, traveling to some of the world's most extreme and dangerous environments in search of organisms that live in conditions analogous to those on Mars. Cabrol was the chief scientist on the team testing an experimental rover in the Atacama Desert in 2002 and was instrumental in choosing the landing site on Mars for Spirit, the rover that explored the planet from 2004 to 2010; she has dived in volcanic lakes at high altitudes to study the creatures within and has designed and installed an autonomous floating robot on an Andean lake that simulated lakes on Titan, one of Saturn's moons.</Para><Para>I met Cabrol in October 2016 in Antofagasta, Chile, a port city of oxide-colored high-rises and copper sculptures that sprawls between dry hills and the dark Pacific. Over the next 26 days, she led an expedition to Chile's high-altitude deserts to test methods of detecting life on Mars. I was there to join the team; I had brought with me a sleeping bag, altitude-sickness pills and anxiety about the extreme conditions that lay ahead.</Para><Para>Petite and slight, with short-cropped silver hair and a striking, finely carved handsomeness, Cabrol, who is 54, resembles Isabella Rossellini with an otherworldly dash of David Bowie. Her eyes resemble gray-green polished granite, emphatically outlined with eyeliner, even when she is in the desert. She's charismatic, warm and extremely funny but possesses an indefinable, unpredictable wildness: Talking to her sometimes disconcertingly reminded me of encounters I have had with forest animals uncertain whether to flee or defend themselves. That first bright morning in Antofagasta, I watched her break into peals of smoky laughter as she held up a SETI Institute flag for the camera.</Para><Para>The search for life beyond Earth has entered a new phase in the past few decades. Some models have suggested that perhaps 100 million planets in the Milky Way could hold complex multicellular life. We have learned too that planets need not closely resemble Earth to potentially harbor life; subsurface oceans on distant moons like Saturn's Enceladus and Titan, for instance, could support microbial organisms. The universe, Cabrol told me, is probably full of such simple life, and the purpose of this expedition would be to refine methods of finding it -- of detecting biosignatures. These are signs of life, or lives once lived: organisms, or the structures they have made, even the chemical compounds they have produced.</Para><Para>Over the next few weeks, we would visit five sites at varying altitudes. The higher we climbed, the further we went back in time -- not on Earth, but on Mars. The high-altitude sites are water-rich, with a thin atmosphere and high levels of UV radiation. They resemble Mars at the beginning of the transition it underwent three and a half billion years ago, when solar winds began to strip away its atmosphere, allowing cosmic rays to reach its surface, and the water that once flowed there vanished into space or was locked deep underground or at the planet's poles. During this period, any life on the surface would have died or taken refuge in the same kinds of places in which life exists in inhospitable regions like the Atacama. The surface of Mars is exposed to harmful radiation; no life can survive on it today, Cabrol told me, but it might still be hiding underground. The salty, arid sites we visited first were terrestrial analogues for present-day Mars.</Para><Para>For Cabrol, there is much more in the search for life on Mars than answering the old question, ''Are we alone?'' Billions of years ago, rocks thrown off by comets and asteroids colliding with Earth reached Mars, and vice versa. Perhaps some carried early life. Finding evidence of the transition from prebiotic chemistry to life here on Earth is impossible, because any such records were long ago destroyed by the Earth's rapid geological activity, by erosion and plate tectonics. But ancient rocks from the time Mars's crust cooled down are still present on that planet's surface; if we share our ancestry with Mars, traces of our own life might still be found there. ''Mars may hold that secret for us,'' Cabrol says. ''This is why Mars is so special to us.''</Para><Para>Salar Grande</Para><Para>In October 2016, Cabrol was in her second year of leading the SETI Institute team on its biosignature-detection expedition to Chile. A stiff Pacific breeze blew dead mimosa blossoms across the sidewalk as I climbed inside a minibus to join them on the long drive to our first field site, where the team would spend three days sampling and working out how to find signs of life. Through the blue-tinted windows, the soft yellows and buff oxides of weathered rock and sand were turned a dusty, livid red. Fredrik Rehnmark, a mechanical engineer from Honeybee Robotics, was delighted. ''If they built a road on Mars, it would look like this!'' he exclaimed.</Para><Para>We drove north, passing pale rocks arranged in patterns of names and initials on hillsides. Almost nothing moves in this desert. There are places that haven't much changed in five million years. Those names written in stone are a kind of biosignature that will outlive not just the people who set them there but all of us and all we know.</Para><Para>Salt began to spread along the edges of the sandy road as we turned inland. Time drifted. Everything outside the windows was so featureless that it seemed like a theatrical backdrop. At the site, we set up tents on the shores of Salar Grande, a nine-mile-long salt flat that was a lake millions of years ago. There are flats similar to this on Mars.</Para><Para>The salty air made my face twitch and burn; I blinked constantly. The hyperarid core of the Atacama was far to the east; where we were, fog rolled in from the Pacific to shape the landscape around us. Close up, the salt flat was composed of broad polygonal plates whose edges were heaped with something that looked like half-melted lemon sorbet, or the dirty, refrozen snow that collects along the roadside in winter. Other salt nodules were heaped in piles like dry and dirty bones, and the ground behind our tents was littered with the detritus of long-abandoned salt-mining operations.</Para><Para>Drills echoed in the morning air. The engineers from Honeybee were excavating salt cores to test prototype tools for future rovers. A team from the University of Tennessee deployed a drone to map the terrain, a tiny dark star that sounded like a distant nest of wasps. The SETI Institute research scientist Pablo Sobron analyzed salt samples with a laser spectrometer; one will be a feature on future rovers. And students from the Catholic University of the North in Antofagasta were collecting salt nodules for microbiological lab analysis with the SETI Institute/NASA scientists Kim Warren-Rhodes and Alfonso Davila.</Para><Para>Cabrol picked up a chunk of salt and held it to the light. ''Look,'' she said. Inside the nodule were two bright bands of color: pink on top, green below. These were communities of halophilic -- salt-loving -- microbes that can survive this extreme environment only by living inside translucent nodules. The green bacteria photosynthesize nutrients from the light filtering through the pink colony above. The pink pigment works as a sunscreen, protecting both colonies from UV radiation that would otherwise damage their DNA.</Para><Para>I had been walking on these nodules all day, and I hadn't seen the life beneath my feet. ''Habitability is not something very obvious,'' Cabrol said. ''It can be hidden.'' I looked at her slight figure, the salt dusting her gloved fingertips, the faintly mischievous smile on her face, and then stared out at the vastness of the landscape around us. It was dizzying to think of the scales her work spans: millions of miles of space, billions of years of planetary evolution, the vastness of the universe, the canyons and valleys of Mars, the expanse of salt here, our small forms standing upon it, and these exquisitely tough, tiny, almost invisible signs of life held between finger and thumb.</Para><Para>Paris</Para><Para>An only child, Cabrol spent a lot of time alone in her family's small apartment while her parents worked, and in her solitude she created an imaginative, hermetic world of her own to live in, filling her hours with words and symbols and numbers, writing stories and tracing lines upon atlases. She told me that as a child she had a talent for connecting things that were not obvious to others. She believes that this is still one of her greatest strengths as a scientist. But even as she started to apprehend the vastness of space, her social world remained circumscribed. ''For a long time,'' she said, ''I thought that I could do without interacting with others. I didn't have many friends at all, and I didn't look for them. I had enough. I was busy enough in my mind.'' Her parents saved to buy her astronomy books and magazines. Her mother understood her passion. Her father was less certain. ''For him, that was a phase, you know?'' she said wryly. ''That was a phase that lasted a long time!''</Para><Para>Cabrol's teenage years were troubled. Things were difficult at home, where her parents were fighting; she didn't fit in and was bullied at school. Some of her schoolteachers thought she lived in a fantasy world. Although she wanted to study planetary sciences, she studied the humanities, for until she taught it to herself later in her career, math was not her forte.</Para><Para>Cabrol was taking earth sciences in her final year at Paris Nanterre University when her lab director suggested that she visit the historic Meudon Observatory south of Paris to meet Prof. André Cailleux, a pioneer in planetary geology. Cailleux showed her maps of Mars and explained that his colleagues were working on the history of water on the planet. Would she be interested in joining them? ''All these years I thought I was going 180 degrees from where I needed to go, but the path was taking me exactly where I needed to be,'' she told me. Stepping out from that first meeting, she gazed around at the observatory domes and felt them strangely familiar. ''All these domes I had been drawing as a little girl, always repeating the same landscape, the planetary landscape, of a planet that was completely desert. And with Saturn in the background, always a dark sky and domes.'' At Meudon, she had finally found a way to get nearer to Mars.</Para><Para>During the day she was working on her master's degree on the evolution of water-carved valleys on Mars, but she spent her nights looking through Meudon's famous 19th-century telescope, the Grande Lunette, dragging a sleeping bag there to rest between hours of observing. Through the eyepiece, there was Mars, small. At first she couldn't see much, but the more she looked, the more she saw on the dusky, changing face of the planet that would become a focus of her career, a planet whose gullies and dried lakes have become as familiar to her as the backs of her hands. And it was at Meudon too that she had a moment that left an indelible mark. Prof. Audouin Dollfus, the eminent astronomer who discovered Saturn's satellite Janus, asked her if she would like to see moon dust. ''Duh! Do I want to see lunar dust?!''</Para><Para>He produced a small container from a safe, and Cabrol looked at it and was disappointed. ''I had a feeling like: So? That's it?'' she told me. Politely enthusiastic but secretly unmoved, she left the lab to go home, but when she looked up and saw the moon hanging bright over Paris, she was suddenly stricken with awe. ''All of a sudden this moon dust that looked like nothing looked like the most precious thing ever,'' she said. ''Because it is not so much what it is but the journey it took to get here.'' It was a revelation. ''I don't think that anything I saw through an eyepiece told me the same thing: the journey it took, the spirit of exploration, the danger of exploration, the things you have to accept, that there is a sacrifice, and the sacrifice might be your own life.''</Para><Para>Exploration lit her imagination. ''I breathe it, imagine it every day of my life, and I dream about it at night,'' she wrote recently in a private manuscript. She told me of a childhood memory: her father opening prickly sweet chestnut cases for her, uncovering the glossy, marbled nuts inside. She was entranced. Early moments like this planted the desire for discovery inside her, an urge to find again the wonder of seeing hidden things brought to light.</Para><Para>While working on the question of how flowing water formed lakes on Mars for her Ph.D. at the Sorbonne, Cabrol met Edmond Grin, an eminent retired hydrogeologist who had gone back to earn a Ph.D. in astrophysics. ''This is his thing,'' she told me. ''When he has nothing to do, he plays with Einstein's equations.'' She was 23 and he was 66 when she first saw him talking to a professor before her class began. ''For some reason,'' she said, ''I could not look in any other direction. I was stuck. I was looking at him, and at that time in my brain, that was like: I know this man. I know this person. From where do I know him?'' He sat near her in the class, they looked at each other and ''that was it -- it took us, you know?'' she said. ''I cannot explain, but I was waiting for him to show up.'' In the years that followed, Grin helped focus her work and her research methodology and was a transformative presence in deeper ways. ''He did a magical act on me,'' she told me. ''From being an introvert writing those codes and symbols and novels and papers, it's like he took a glove and turned it inside out, and all of a sudden everything that was inside came out.''</Para><Para>When Cabrol traveled to NASA's Ames Research Center in Silicon Valley in 1994 to work on a landing-site study for a proposed mission to search for life on Mars, Grin went with her. All they took with them was a suitcase. Inside it was a map of the Gusev Crater on Mars, made of taped-together photocopied images from the Viking mission, the unmanned spacecraft that surveyed and landed on the planet in the 1970s. ''The two of us had to take a very big leap of faith,'' she said. More than 30 years later, they are still together, still inseparable, now married. In 2010, they edited ''Lakes on Mars,'' the first academic book on the subject. Cabrol calls him Merlin, after the magician. He has grown frail now, and this was the first time Cabrol had been to the Atacama without him. That he had to stay behind was a source of deep sadness for her, something that I realized only later in the expedition, when she left the group at a lookout near San Pedro de Atacama to walk down an incline and gaze at the pyramidal, distant slopes of Licancabur, a volcano they once climbed together. She looked small and terribly alone.</Para><Para>Salar de Pajonales</Para><Para>We moved south, up onto to the altiplano, the second-largest plateau on Earth, where the landscape had an astonishing luminosity; it glowed like a scene painted on fine bone china. It was wetter too; there were golden grasses on the hillsides. When Cabrol first came to this place and saw the snow-capped Andes, it was a shock. She felt as if she were back somewhere she belonged. There was a connection, just as when she first saw the Atacama Desert through a live feed from an experimental rover, its arid landscape projected onto a screen in a science-operation room. Even with that distance, that robotic mediation, she told me, ''the love story started,'' and ''there was something that I knew was drawing me to this place.''</Para><Para>She has a similar affinity to the Gusev Crater, a 100-mile-wide impact crater into which water may once have poured from the immense canyon of Ma'adim Vallis. She and Grin studied it and chose it as a landing site for the Spirit rover. ''I had the same feeling when I first saw Gusev from the surface. I was the first person on the planet to see a new landscape. And you don't get over this. You cannot. I will die with these images. It's in me forever.''</Para><Para>On one long expedition drive, Cabrol stared out the window, her shoulders tense with what I realized was anticipation only when we crested a rise and saw the first dark peaks of volcanoes before us. She turned to us all with a blazing smile. ''I'm home,'' she announced.</Para><Para>At first, Salar de Pajonales appeared as a white patch between dark volcanic slopes, but as we drove through its broad expanse of gypsum sands, sunlight flashed across thousands of crystalline flakes, ephemeral points of fierce white light. The salts here were chemically different from those at Salar Grande. Cabrol visited the site briefly five years ago and was thrilled to return and discover what it held. Underfoot, the ground crunched and tinkled -- it was like treading on sugar mixed with broken glass. Huge bosses of gypsum were dotted around us, round structures like crumbling coral, the color of milk chocolate. Fascinated, I pulled out the sun-rotted blades closest to their surface with my hands, as if extracting teeth.</Para><Para>Life was less easy to locate here. Only when Bill Diamond, the SETI Institute's chief executive, kicked a rock did we find a broken chunk colonized by those familiar microbes in shades of pink and green. Her face half obscured by mirrored glasses and a scarf, Cabrol tenderly uncovered the fossilized imprints of ancient bacterial colonies called stromatolites. They looked like pitted fragile cups, chalky fingerprint impressions. Samples were photographed, noted, bagged to be sent on to the lab. Overhead, the drone was mapping this terrain, struggling in the wind.</Para><Para>That afternoon, I hopped in a truck with a biologist and a biochemist from the Catholic University of the North who wanted to take bacterial samples from a nearby lake. Its turquoise waters were surrounded with pale gypsum blades like thickets of kitchen knives. It was too surreal; I returned to the truck, feeling unaccountably blinded, though I could see. It was if a white light shone behind my eyes. My nose ran; my sinuses ached. The things I wrote in my notebook had become increasingly bizarre. I scrawled questions asked in glass across a whole page, an uncanny aide-mémoire for something I never remembered. As we drove back to the main study site, I saw Cabrol in the distance, a slight shadow moving slowly across the pale fire of sunbaked gypsum, something strangely like a mirage of a person.</Para><Para>That night we slept in an abandoned mining camp. In the early hours, in the rat-dropping-dusted particleboard and corrugated-iron shack we were using in lieu of tents, I lay in increasingly irritated denial until I dragged myself out of my sleeping bag to pee. It was minus 0.4 degrees outside. Above me, the Southern Hemisphere stars were all dust and terror and distance and slow fire in the night, and I stared up, frozen, and frozen in wonderment.</Para><Para>El Tatio</Para><Para>We climbed higher still, to volcanic sites that resemble formations found on Mars, so high that there wasn't enough oxygen for the engine of our minibus. It stalled halfway to our destination. We went back to Antofagasta and rented a new minibus. This also stalled. When we finally reached the geyser field of El Tatio, it was deserted. At about 14,000 feet, it is one of the highest active geothermal sites in the world. Tourists flock here at dawn, when the freezing air turns the site into columns of roiling steam. Some geysers were low to the ground and hardly visible, just a faint shimmering of warm air above them; others looked like tall berms of clay pouring out thick gouts of steam. This kind of volcanic, fumarolic environment would have been present four billion years ago on Mars, and old hydrothermal environments like it are one of the most likely habitats to hold life, or the remains of former life, on the planet.</Para><Para>Cabrol donned her red-and-black rucksack, black fleece hat and mirrored glasses, picked up a geologic hammer and started hacking at an inactive geyser. The surface looked devoid of life, but she was delighted to discover bright emerald colonies of chasmoliths -- microbes that live in cracks and fissures -- thriving on the underside of lumps of geyserite. The hot springs here were full of algal mats and organisms that had evolved to live in water that is almost boiling; they glowed purple and dark pink, their colors protection against UV rays.</Para><Para>Cabrol has always been drawn to both volcanoes and lakes, fire and water. They're completely opposite, she said, ''but if they work synergistically together, they create steam, which is a source of energy. And then you can produce power. And you create things with that. But if the water goes on the fire, then you have destruction. And my entire life is just trying to find this balance between creation and destruction. For the things that I create and the things that are eating me inside. And it's a very fine balance.'' There is a pattern in her life, she tells me, where the highest of highs are swiftly followed by the lowest of lows. She spoke to me of the deaths of her mentors, friends and family members, of times she came close to death, of times when she struggled with inner darkness. ''What people see in me is the successful woman, the leader, but all of this is built on sweat and work and temper, you know? It's losses, tragedy, death and tears. I guess you cannot be strong if you never have been hurt and learn how to survive that.'' As she told me this, she looked bone-tired. It was the third week of our expedition, and she was sleeping badly, two or so hours a night, she said. And the altitude medicine she was taking was making her sick.</Para><Para>Cabrol's search for life in extreme conditions began in the Atacama but took a turn in 2000, after she watched a French television documentary that showed the crater lake atop Licancabur on the Bolivian altiplano. There it was, onscreen, the perfect place to search for extremophile life adapted to the punishing conditions of high-altitude lakes. She wrote a research proposal and three years later donned a black wet suit with a weighted belt and free-dived into the lake at an altitude of nearly 20,000 feet, discovering zooplankton species new to science.</Para><Para>''Water is my thing,'' Cabrol told me. ''I feel comfortable. I feel at peace.'' On a family vacation when she was 2, she wore water wings to float on the surface of Lake Garda in Italy. She clambered onshore, took off the wings and went back to the water. ''I am thinking to myself that if I go underwater, I cannot sink,'' she laughed. Submerged, she swam instinctively in a new world of shining pebbles and vivid colors. She learned to free-dive as a teenager in Cap d'Agde in the south of France. ''It was always beautiful and peaceful; there was no stress,'' she said. ''There was this sense of being responsible for myself, of being in charge and seeing beautiful things, and exploration and discovery.'' We were talking in her tent, and the silence between her words was filled with the crack and ripple of nylon stock, the sides of the tent inhaling and exhaling in the wind, the floor billowing up around our planted feet.</Para><Para>''When I entered that lake,'' she said, ''I was thinking I was entering the past, actually entering a time machine that was telling me what Mars was like four billion years ago. It's really a place where time and space get warped.'' Diving in these high lakes provoked emotional states, she said, that were intensely beautiful and spiritual. There was one time, in 2006, when she was suspended in the middle of the volcanic lake, caught midway between earth and sky, the water arctic blue and each ray of sunlight diffracting around her, so that she felt surrounded by diamonds. ''And on top of that,'' she said, ''copepods, little zooplankton, tiny shrimps, and they are so red. It's a symphony of color. I'm suspended like that, and time stands still. And for one fraction of a second, everything is perfect. I don't need to have to explain anything. For that very moment, you understand everything. And there is nothing to understand.'' Then she remembered she was on a not-so-dormant volcano. ''I thought, I have a suit and 45 minutes of oxygen,'' she said and shook her head. ''My last thought would have been so serene and so peaceful.''</Para><Para>Chilifornia</Para><Para>As we took the trucks in a convoy up to our final site, I looked back on the Atacama and thought of the Apollo astronauts. Far behind and below us was a haze-softened blue expanse streaked with clouds, making this climb feel like a journey away from Earth. We were among volcanoes now, vast blisters on the plateau. Cabrol pointed out Simba, which the group planned to climb to sample the bacteria in its crater lake. Cabrol has a history with Simba. In 2007, she was climbing it with her team when the Tocopilla earthquake hit. They avoided the avalanches, but when Lascar, the volcano sharing a slope with Simba, began to emit poisonous gases, Cabrol fell into what she called a ''surgically cold'' mind-set, concerned only with logic, practicality, survival. During their descent, a large tumbling rock just missed her. ''And this,'' she said, ''was when I got mad.'' She stood up in the middle of the gully and started yelling at the volcano. '' 'Is it going to be all today?! Is there anything yet you can?!' I was shouting! I was outraged!'' She got everyone down safely and then nearly passed out in the truck back to base camp -- partly from an adrenaline crash, partly from the knowledge that everyone might have died.</Para><Para>We camped under an extinct volcano, in an abandoned military barracks that the team called Chilifornia. The cinder-block rectangle had no roof, but the walls sheltered our tents from the wind. Cabrol warned us not to go wandering. In the 1970s, this territory was disputed with neighboring Bolivia, and there are still land mines here. I grew even more anxious when I heard Cabrol and Cristian Tambley, who was handling logistics for the expedition, talking about installing UV-monitoring systems in this region. Strong UV radiation damages DNA. The World Health Organization warns against being outside when the UV index is over 11. In 2003 and 2004, Cabrol observed unexplained UV storms here of extraordinary intensity, though they lasted only a few hours. On Licancabur, she detected UV spikes of over 43. That night I dreamed of wearing a spacesuit.</Para><Para>It was an hour's drive to Laguna Lejía the next morning, a copper-colored lake shivering with sunlight. Cabrol was shocked when we arrived. ''It's substantially reduced in size compared with when I last saw it, in 2009,'' she said. ''Our planet is actually changing in front of our eyes,'' she told me later, ''at a speed that is extremely scary.'' The route we were traveling was once a drive route for cattle from Argentina into Chile, and I couldn't look away from the bones littering the place. The skulls left behind were so old that the keratin layers of their horns had peeled apart, resembling delicate pine cones or the brittle pages of old books left in the sun.</Para><Para>Cabrol has worked closely with robotics engineers for many years, and her 2011 Planetary Lake Lander project set an autonomous floating robot in Laguna Negra in the Andes. Ever since, Cabrol has made it her mission to push the two things together: climate change on Mars and climate change on Earth. The Planetary Lake Lander wasn't just preparation for future missions to lakes and seas beyond Earth, or simply an analogue for climate change on Mars, but a way of investigating climate change here and now. The region near Laguna Negra is suffering from rapid deglaciation.</Para><Para>We saw that change too. We traveled to another lake, surrounded by creeks and frozen grass. The wind was brutal, the sky the hardest blue. Cabrol crouched at a site where she found freshwater springs seven years ago. Fascinated and forlorn, she told us that this was like Mars three billion years ago. The surface water was receding, but there was some water underneath. She was shocked by how fast the climate was changing here. ''Seven years ago, this was a beautiful spring, a pond with zooplankton, but now you can't tell the difference between this and the rest of the desert.'' She scraped gently at frozen mud with the point of her geologic hammer. Later, she pointed out that the Earth itself in is no danger whatsoever. ''It will survive whatever we throw at it. What is in danger is the environment that made us possible. We are pretty much cutting the branch we are sitting on. So either we understand that very quickly, or life will go on -- but a different one.'' She thinks it will not be a slow disappearance. ''It's going to be sudden and frightening,'' she said.</Para><Para>At night in my sleeping bag, I woozily speculated on the meaning of life and death, the fate of Earth, the end of things. I asked Mario, one of the expedition doctors, if déjà vu was a recognized symptom of altitude. ''Absolutely,'' he said. I was relieved. It kept happening. It was starting to scare me. The day before, a llama sheltering from the wind behind an outcrop stepped down with leisurely, measured grace across talc-dusted slabs of rock. I knew I'd seen it before. More than twice, certainly. Perhaps five times, six. I knew I hadn't, of course, but these miraged recollections were instantly telescoped and pleated together like a pack of cards all of the same suit flicked through with a thumb. There was a sense that reality is unreliable here, as if I could put a hand to the air and it could slip right through to another universe if I wasn't paying sufficient attention, or paying too much. As if I could free another reality by rubbing corners of air together like trying to open a recalcitrant plastic bag. And the wind poured on us as we drove, making dust devils spin over the distances, all outside seemingly inimical to breath.</Para><Para>These high places, Cabrol told me, were sacred to the Inca people, who would climb the mountains here to make ritual offerings to the gods. Crouching behind a rock to keep us out of the sharp mountain wind, she explained how up here the scientific search for life beyond Earth and the spiritual search for meaning cannot help running in parallel. ''The Incas would come here to the mountains to ask questions of God -- and so, in a way, are we,'' she said. ''That's the same question. Who we are, where we are coming from, what's out there. We are trying to connect to our own origins. So we are doing this scientifically; they were doing it in a more intuitive way.''</Para><Para>Cabrol deeply respects the cultural history of the landscapes she works in. Her Quechua guide Macario made offerings to Pachamama, an Incan goddess, before he and Cabrol's team climbed volcanoes, and Cabrol always makes offerings, usually crystal spheres, to the high crater lakes she dives in on mountains. She had planned to climb to Simba's crater lake at the expedition's end, but she hadn't brought an offering to give its blood-colored waters. Tentatively, she asked me if I had anything that might work as a replacement. I gave her a piece of lapis lazuli polished into the shape of an egg that I bought in San Pedro de Atacama. The exchange seemed an entirely rational act. Both halves of Cabrol, scientific and spiritual, are perfectly conjoined in her work, in her insistent, careful reaching for the deepest of questions: Why are we here?</Para><Para>Lascar</Para><Para>Cabrol was staring at plumes of vapor that rose from the volcano on the near horizon. Bright white at their bases, they softened rapidly into haze that went up and up, before losing coherence and resolution against the sky. The steam was ascending vertically, even in this vicious wind, so there was serious force behind it. The volcano was Lascar, which shares a slope with Simba. And the team had people on Simba right now, local guides preparing our ascent.</Para><Para>Cabrol called everyone in. We stood in a line before her, waiting for orders. She pushed her mirrored glasses up onto her hat, speaking with terse, absolute authority. As soon as the guides were down from Simba, she said, we would go back to camp. She would get out the satellite phone and speak to Bill Diamond, who was now back at the SETI Institute, and call the United States Geological Survey and the University of Chile to find out more about the situation here. And then we would need to decide not only if the team should cancel the planned ascent of Simba but also whether any of us should stay in camp at all.</Para><Para>There was no immediate bad news, so we decided to stay. Cabrol would keep an eye on Lascar's activity and let us know if it worsened. She told us to sleep in our clothes and keep our passports at hand, ready to leave in the middle of the night if need be. All of this gave me a strange kind of dread. It had a lazy, slow, opiated quality. It had been a long time since I had none of the tools I needed to judge a situation. There had recently been a 5.5-magnitude earthquake in Calama, an hour and a half away. And if water made its way into the magma chamber beneath the volcano, the volcano might explode. These facts weren't comforting. I withdrew to my little orange tent, sat on my cot and looked at photos of home on my phone. Outside, the light was dying on the old volcano. I could hear people packing and the generator buzzing behind the cinder-block wall. Tambley was assembling a weather station and playing Pink Floyd's ''Shine On You Crazy Diamond,'' the saddest of songs, on his laptop. Zips, whispers, laughter, the sounds of Pelican cases being hauled over rough ground.</Para><Para>I stared at my hands. They looked like ancient lizard skin, each crease outlined in pale dust. All my clothes were white with it. My hair felt like greased fur. There was a moth in my tent, but I was too numb to move it. Blankly, I watched this scrap of life bump about the orange walls. The tent flap was open; all it needed to do was turn around and fly the other way. It didn't. I lost sight of it for long minutes, then jumped at its touch. It had bumbled its way onto my hand and rested there, quivering. I put it outside. We left the next day.</Para><Para>Sign up for our newsletter to get the best of The New York Times Magazine delivered to your inbox every week.</Para></TailParas><Byline fid="by" index="field">By HELEN MACDONALD </Byline><Credit fid="cr" index="field"></Credit><Contact fid="ct" index="field"></Contact><Notes fid="rf" index="field">Helen Macdonald is a contributing writer for the magazine and the author of the best-selling memoir ''H Is for Hawk.''
