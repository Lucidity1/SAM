But the unwavering support of other adults showed him love and hope, and today he devotes it to paying it forward, he told The Straits Times in this series about inspiring millennials.</Para><Para>SINGAPORE - Mr Dominique Dillon, 28, remembers vividly the first time he knew he was different from other children.</Para></LeadPara></HandL><TailParas fid="td"><Para>He was with other seven-year-old classmates, and it dawned on him that his friends all had a father, except him. His parents were never married.</Para><Para>"I felt left out and ashamed of who I was," the only child said. "To avoid my classmates' questions, I would tell them my dad had died. But some of them still called me a bastard child and poked fun at me."</Para><Para>For as long as he could remember, he had felt rejected and unwanted by his father, a man he met only a few times, but whose presence he missed.</Para><Para>He and his mother, who died about five months ago, struggled. She suffered from bipolar disorder, a mental illness marked by extreme mood swings, and had heart and kidney problems, which made it hard for her to work.</Para><Para>The pair depended on financial aid from the Government and a Catholic group, as well as maintenance from his father.</Para><Para>His mother had been a nursing aide who quit her job to care for her son. She told him she and his father had planned to marry but things did not work out.</Para><Para>He said: "Life was not easy for us, but mum would always make sure there was food on the table and that I had all the love and discipline that I needed."</Para><Para>But even with food on the table and a roof over their heads, as his mother owned a three-room flat, he often felt, growing up, that he was trying not to drown in a pit of rage and shame. The bleakest point came when his mother was hospitalised after suffering a relapse when he was 12 years old. There was no one to care for him and he was sent to live in a home for boys for about half a year.</Para><Para>He said: "I felt the most alone then and the older kids bullied me."</Para><Para>After his mother was discharged from hospital, she visited him at the home every day without fail. Eventually, he went home to live with her.</Para><Para>But by the time he was in secondary school, his rage was threatening to consume him. He would blow up at the smallest slights in school. At home, he fought with his mother over little things. They loved each other dearly, but he said he could not deal with his own pain, much less her mood swings and depression. Mr Dillon and his mother loved each other dearly, but he said he could not deal with his own pain, much less her mood swings and depression. "We were like two angry lions fighting." PHOTO: COURTESY OF DOMINIQUE DILLON</Para><Para>"We were like two angry lions fighting," he said. "I felt no one understood my pain. And I was furious because I felt some looked down on me for being in the Normal Technical stream."</Para><Para>Once, as the class monitor, he was trying to get the class to be quiet and settle down for the next lesson. When one boy just would not sit down, Mr Dillon lost it and threw a chair at him.</Para><Para>His teacher saw the whole thing and, realising he needed professional help, referred him to Care Singapore, a charity that helps vulnerable youth.</Para><Para>Looking back now, Mr Dillon can recognise the guardian angels that helped to save him - and his mother as well.</Para><Para>There were the youth workers from Care Singapore, who counselled him and showed him how to deal with his inner turmoil.</Para><Para>There was his benefactor, who paid his fees and gave him an allowance every month of $300 while he was at Nanyang Polytechnic. Mr Dillon got to know the businessman through the Catholic group that was helping his family.</Para><Para>And the men he looked up to in church - Father Gerard Louis, a priest, and a youth worker, Prem Augustine - were unstinting in their patience with him and guidance, despite his rough edges. In many ways, they were his father figures.</Para><Para>Mr Dillon credits his faith as being instrumental in healing him of his scars.</Para><Para>"Through them, I felt loved despite my brokenness and ugliness. It breathed new life into me," he said. "Without all of them, I could have been a school dropout."</Para><Para>With the support of these other adults in his life, he graduated with a diploma in Mechatronics Engineering. But he knew that his career lay elsewhere.</Para><Para>Others had reached out to him when he was poor, lost and abandoned. Now, he wanted to do the same for young people in similar predicaments.</Para><Para>He said some people had advised him not to go into youth work, as they felt it pays a lot less than an engineer.

"Because of his background, he understands what youth are going through and he empathises with them. He has a lot of passion in helping young people."</Para><Para>While life has become more comfortable now that he is earning an income, his one big regret is that he did not do enough for his mother while she was alive.</Para><Para>She died in October last year of heart failure. She was 62.</Para><Para>"I miss her a lot and I feel a bit lost," he said. "My mum sacrificed everything for me. She loved me so much and she never once gave up on me."</Para></TailParas><Byline fid="by" index="field">Theresa Tan </Byline><Credit fid="cr" index="field"></Credit><Contact fid="ct" index="field"></Contact><Notes fid="rf" index="field"></Notes><Art fid="art" index="field"></Art><Copyright fid="cy" index="field">(c) 2018 Singapore Press Holdings Limited </Copyright></Article></ArchiveDoc><AdocTOC adoctype="article"><Item size="0" ref="distdoc:archive/ArchiveDoc::Article" type="arttext"></Item><Item size="0" ref="distdoc:archive/InvertText" type="invtext"></Item></AdocTOC></DistDoc>
