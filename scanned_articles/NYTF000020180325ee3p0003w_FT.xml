Akhil Sharma's ''A Life of Adventure and Delight,'' Valeria Luiselli's ''Tell Me How It Ends,'' Xiaolu Guo's ''Nine Continents: A Memoir In and Out of China,'' Tayari Jones's ''An American Marriage,'' Tarfia Faizullah's ''Registers of Illuminated Villages,'' William Brewer's ''I Know Your Kind,'' Fernando Valverde's ''Selected Poems.'' And Matthew Zapruder's ''Why Poetry?,'' Eve L. Ewing's ''Electric Arches,'' Jenny Xie's forthcoming ''Eye Level,'' Layli Long Soldier's ''Whereas'' and Nicole Dennis-Benn's ''Here Comes the Sun.''</Para><Para>Who is your favorite novelist of all time?</Para><Para>I join the enormous chorus of readers who have been most moved, changed, deepened and inspired by Toni Morrison. But I also have a deep visceral memory of the joy and exhilaration of reading Elena Ferrante's Neapolitan novels a couple of summers ago. And I find Jamaica Kincaid's mind and voice utterly mesmerizing, no matter what she is writing about.</Para><Para>Whom do you consider the best writers -- novelists, essayists, critics, memoirists, poets -- working today?</Para><Para>Linda Gregg, Kevin Young, Brenda Shaughnessy, Mark Doty, Marie Howe, W. S. Merwin, Colm Toibin, Zadie Smith, Tessa Hadley, Hilton Als and Claudia Rankine. It's hard to put a period at the end of that list, but those are the first of many that come to mind. And I'm truly ecstatic about new work by the current generation of black poets: Morgan Parker, Donika Kelly, Shane McCrae, Danez Smith and others.</Para><Para>Did you read poetry as a child? What books made you fall in love with poetry?</Para><Para>I had a big reading textbook in fifth grade, which I'd race ahead in and find -- to my great excitement -- brief poems by poets like Emily Dickinson and Gwendolyn Brooks. When I was growing up, my father had a series of books whose titles began ''The Works of ....'' Without making a lot of fuss about them, or worrying over the literal sense of them, I read sonnets by Shakespeare and poems by Poe, and loved the feeling that those works created in me. I felt from an early age that poetry was something mysterious, something playful and lilting. As I got older, poems began to offer me new and life-changing ways of looking at the familiar world.</Para><Para>Was there a book of poems or a poet in particular that inspired you to write?</Para><Para>Seamus Heaney's first book, ''Death of a Naturalist,'' made me want to be a poet. More than that, it made me want to be Seamus Heaney, and I imitated him for a long time. I was his student as an undergraduate, and that whole time I was, at least in my heart, imitating him. He was kind and generous enough to guide me gently toward what he recognized as intimations of my own voice and subject matter.</Para><Para>Which poets continue to inspire you?</Para><Para>Lucille Clifton and Elizabeth Bishop are never-ending sources of anchoring and astonishment for me as a poet. The more I read them, the more their poems seem to accomplish. I'm co-translating the contemporary Chinese poet Yi Lei, and her vision of freedom and love, her concerns for humanity and for the planet speak very actively to my own. I'm learning a great deal from living with her voice and her imagination.</Para><Para>Are there poets for whom you've gained greater appreciation over time?</Para><Para>When I first became brave enough to tell people that I wrote poems, so many people would rave to me about Edna St. Vincent Millay's work. I was embarrassed not to have read her and I think that put me off from reading her for a long time. So many of her poems are just impeccable. I love the subtlety and the tiny, yet significant, gestures driving poems like ''Ebb'' and ''The Fitting.''</Para><Para>As poet laureate of the United States, you've been traveling across the country to meet with people in underserved communities. What books do you recommend to them? And have they in turn pointed you to any neglected or unfamiliar writers?</Para><Para>I find myself sharing poems by other poets on these trips, which is something I didn't used to do at readings. Some of the voices I've been excited to celebrate so far are Natalie Diaz, Aracelis Girmay, John Yau, Patrick Rosal, Laura Kasischke and Chen Chen. I like that these are poets living and writing in America today, each with different thematic concerns, different approaches to language and different ideas about what it means to belong to this place made up of many places. And I feel very lucky that I get to meet other poets in my travels. In New Mexico, I met dg okpik, an Inupiaq-Inuit poet whose work draws Inuit creation stories into conversation with a personal exploration of self, family and the natural world. And I read recently with Kealoha, the poet laureate of Hawaii, whose performance piece ''The Story of Everything'' traces the origin of the universe from the Big Bang until now.</Para><Para>If you had to name one book that made you who you are today, what would it be?</Para><Para>''Little Women'' made me into a reader. About a decade later, I wrote one of my college admissions essays on Thoreau's ''Walden.'' I have no memory of what I might have said then about the book, though I do remember loving its various paradoxes and the beautiful spacious sense of self, nature and possibility that the prose fostered. I was longing for the kind of largeness of spirit and rhetorical authority of a writer like Thoreau. I didn't encounter Emerson until college, but I think I was an aspiring Transcendentalist from a young age.</Para><Para>What genres do you especially enjoy reading? And which do you avoid?</Para><Para>I have three kids, so children's literature is a big part of my life. At one time, I thought I'd raise my kids on the classic books from my childhood: ''Little House in the Big Woods,'' Beverly Cleary's wonderful Ramona books, ''Black Beauty.'' It's been great to revisit some of those titles as a parent, but my children have guided me to the joys of contemporary children's literature. Jacqueline Woodson's books are such a gift to parents and children for their poignant subtlety and lyricism, and their willingness to let a reader dwell in the pangs of realization that we sometimes try to protect our children from. I'm thinking of ''Each Kindness'' and ''The Other Side.'' My daughter is 8 and loves the way that private and public history intersect in ''Feathers.'' Many picture books have fostered inroads for talking with our kids about history: Margaret H. Mason's ''These Hands'' tells the story of racial discrimination at the Wonder Bread factory in the 1950s and '60s. Selina Alko's ''The Case for Loving'' tells the story behind the Supreme Court's Loving v. Virginia decision. And then there are books that have given us a wonderfully useful vocabulary for feelings of anger or longing, like Barbara O'Connor's ''Wish.''</Para><Para>I have to say that I just haven't found a way to get excited about ''Harry Potter,'' though my daughter and husband loved the series. I loved C. S. Lewis as a kid, so I thought I'd have a toehold in that world, but invariably I'd get about two paragraphs in and fall asleep. Maybe I'll be ready to face those books in a few more years when they come around for our boys.</Para><Para>What books might we be surprised to find on your shelves?</Para><Para>Perhaps because I've lost both my parents, I really appreciate Elisabeth Kübler-Ross's books on death and dying.</Para><Para>What do you plan to read next?</Para><Para>Emily Wilson's translation of ''The Odyssey.''</Para><Para>Follow New York Times Books on Facebook and Twitter , sign up for our newsletter or our literary calendar .
