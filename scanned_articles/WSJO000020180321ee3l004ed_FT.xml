series</Para></Headline></Title><LeadPara fid="lp"><Para>"Billions," a Showtime series <ELink type="webpage" ref="https://www.wsj.com/articles/billions-review-lifestyles-of-the-rich-and-heinous-1452814725">set in the world of high finance</ELink>, is about the flow of power and money. It is driven by the egos of, for the most part, male characters who spit lines such as "What's the point of having fâ€” you money if you never say fâ€” you?"</Para><Para>The chemistry of this testosterone-laden setup was altered with the introduction of a reserved, androgynous character named Taylor Mason. In the second season, this computational savant came in as an intern to the fictional hedge fund Axe Capital, quickly becoming the secret weapon in its trading strategies.</Para></LeadPara></HandL><TailParas fid="td"><Para>At the start of season 3, set to begin on Sunday, Taylor is serving as the firm's chief investment officer, standing in for cutthroat boss Bobby Axelrod (former "Homeland" star Damian Lewis), who has been sidelined after a sting by prosecutor Chuck Rhoades (Paul Giamatti).</Para><Para>Taylor is played by Asia Kate Dillon. Like the character, the 33-year old actor identifies as gender nonbinary rather than as a man or woman, going by the pronoun "they" instead of "he" or "she." In "Billions," the traders accept Taylor without many probing questions because of the character's brilliance. For Dillon, however, gender issues frequently come to the fore of discussions about casting and performing.</Para><Para>The actor, who has played an inmate on the Netflix series <ELink type="webpage" ref="https://www.wsj.com/articles/television-review-orange-is-the-new-black-murder-in-the-first-and-power-1402015934">"Orange Is the New Black"</ELink> and co-founded the theater company Mirror/Fire productions, discussed growing up in Ithaca, N.Y., boys' and girls' roles in school plays, and the power dynamics of "Billions." Here are excerpts from the conversation.</Para><Para>Many of the male characters in "Billions" are consumed by the pursuit of money. What is Taylor's incentive to succeed?</Para><Para>Taylor wants to see how far down the rabbit hole goes. Taylor is a millennial and a gamer with an objective to be the best. To calculate moves and possible outcomes to win the game. And if not to win, then to lose to the most worthy opponents, in whatever area that competition comes.</Para><Para>Initially, Taylor is hard to read. If they're not bringing bravado, ego and power plays, how are they going to be successful in that world? Taylor doesn't use any of that, just their smarts and their ability to work harder, faster, better, stronger than anyone else in the company. No spoilers, but the ways in which Taylor was unconsciously affected by all that stuff starts to play out in season 3.</Para><Para>When you meet people who actually work on Wall Street, what do they say about Taylor?</Para><Para>The interactions are incredible. I've never had someone say anything negative. For the most part it's people saying, "We wish we had a Taylor at our office." There's also this cute thing I observe with certain hedgies, where I can sense that they're proud of the fact that they care about Taylor as a character. They're like, "This is a thing that is a little weird to me, but I'm OK with it and maybe I'm a more compassionate person than even I thought I was."</Para><Para>Is it difficult to get so many personal questions because of certain similarities with your character?</Para><Para>I spent so many years not understanding my own gender identity and not having the language for it, and not having those conversations, that now I'm so eager to talk about it. Then I learn more about myself and other people. Then they're more likely to have conversations like that with other people, and that's how the world becomes safer for all of us.</Para><Para>Have you created a back story for Taylor?</Para><Para>No, but that's not to say I haven't done that for other characters I've played. Television is different. I only know as much as the next script. If you're doing a play, you have all the informationâ€”the beginning, middle and endâ€”to answer those questions. I could come up with any number of reasons for why Taylor behaves in a certain way, but the show could eventually contradict that. There was a scene where we learn Taylor's dad was fired from his job at NASA, and that's a piece of information about Taylor's past and how it affected them.</Para><Para>You've been acting since you were a kid. How did you feel back then about the roles available to girls and boys?</Para><Para>I remember in middle school we did the musical "Oliver." I loved the movie, and I always wanted to play Oliver. It might not have been stated, but the boys auditioned for Oliver and the girls auditioned for Nancy. But we also did a play called "Li'l Abner," and I was really excited that they let me put on a suit and a fake mustache. Looking back, it was about something more than I understood at the time.</Para><Para>Was it uncomfortable for you to pick or choose?</Para><Para>Yeah, why does it have to be this way? And why, if I'm a girl, do I only get to do certain things? I was socialized as a girl. Assigned female at birth. Girls and women are a marginalized group, so I already had a feeling of, "why can't we just be whatever we want?"</Para><Para>What was your experience in casting and auditions before you got your break?</Para><Para>I moved to New York at 17 to go to school. At 24 I moved back to Ithaca, then moved back to New York at 28. When I came back, I felt like I was more myself than I had been. And so, because I had such a clear sense of who I was and what I was bringing to the table, that's what casting directors and producers were able to pick up on.</Para><Para>But at that stage of a career, actors usually have to take whatever roles they can get.</Para><Para>I grew up poor, financially lower class. Worked in restaurants for 17 years while going to acting school and trying to become a working actor. Because I know what it's like to not have money, I turn down roles if I don't want to play them. I'd rather go pick up five days of work in a restaurant.</Para><Para>Last year, you asked the Television Academy to clarify how gender applies to the actor and actress categories, and you submitted for an Emmy in the "actor" category. Were you satisfied with the way that played out?</Para><Para>Short of "we're changing the categories to just being 'performer' or 'actor,' " their answer was the next best thing. They said, "You're an autonomous performer and you can choose whichever category you want to enter." When you really break it down, separating people by sex as a prerequisite for judging art is archaic. We don't have cinematographer-ess, director-ess. We don't do it in any other place other than the acting categories.</Para><Para>Write to John Jurgensen at <ELink type="webpage" ref="mailto:john.jurgensen@wsj.com">john.jurgensen@wsj.com</ELink></Para></TailParas><Byline fid="by" index="field">By John Jurgensen </Byline><Credit fid="cr" index="field"></Credit><Contact fid="ct" index="field"></Contact><Notes fid="rf" index="field"></Notes><Art fid="art" index="field"></Art><Copyright fid="cy" index="field">Copyright 2018 Dow Jones &amp; Company, Inc.
