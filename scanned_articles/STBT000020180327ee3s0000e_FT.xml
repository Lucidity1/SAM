wants to oust a set of recently-appointed directors in the company.</Para></LeadPara></HandL><TailParas fid="td"><Para>The company issued an eight-page filing on the Singapore Exchange on Tuesday morning, stating that it is "unable to express its confidence in Ms Intan Ng's ability to identify and evaluate new business opportunities" for the company.</Para><Para>This was said in relation to claims Datapulse made against Ms Ng, one of which had to do with an apology letter she issued to Datapulse founder and a fellow executive director Ng Cheow Chye in August 2014. The letter was found in the company's statutory records.</Para><Para>Another claim Datapulse made was that Ms Ng showed insufficient knowledge or misreading of financial records of the company, and was not able to maintain "proper accounting records" as a finance director then.</Para><Para>When contacted by The Business Times, Ms Ng said in response to these claims: "This was a private letter given to Mr Ng Cheow Chye and related to a personal matter which happened a very long time ago, even before the company was listed, and does not concern the affairs of the company. Since the company was listed, I had managed the financial accounts of Datapulse, and my ability had been demonstrated."</Para><Para>Ms Ng, otherwise known as Ng Bie Tjin, is the daughter of Datapulse's co-founder Ng Khim Guan. She was a former finance director at the firm and with a family vehicle Uniseraya Holdings, owns a 16 per cent stake.</Para><Para>She is looking to oust Datapulse's board members including Wilson Teng Wai Leung, CEO &amp; executive director, independent non-executive directors Thomas Ng Der Sian and Rainer Teo Jia Kai, and Low Beng Tin, non-executive chairman and independent director. Mr Teng came on the board on March 19, while the other three parties were appointed in December last year.</Para><Para>During a media briefing on Tuesday, Mr Teng said: "We already have a game plan. If the new board were to come in, what's their game plan? We don't know. There are certain points we have put in place for shareholders to consider choosing a new proposed board. The company remains committed to be more transparent."</Para><Para>On Tuesday, Datapulse also brought claims against Mr Ng Boon Yew, a former independent non-executive director from September 2001 to July 2013. Datapulse was concerned about a business decision Mr Ng and the previous board members made on a S$2 million investment in Raffles Campus in 2004, which they said have widening losses from about S$1 million around the time of the investment to S$9 million by the time the company disposed of its investment two years later.</Para><Para>To this, Mr Ng Boon Yew told BT: "As far as I can recollect, it was a unanimous decision by all the directors (of the old board). Because I am an interested person, obviously I abstain from the whole decision making process. The board and shareholders are fully aware."</Para><Para>The Datapulse saga began when accountant Ng Siew Hong became Datapulse's majority owner after buying a 29 per cent stake from Ng Cheow Chye at a significant premium last November. A new board was then formed on Dec 11, 2017 and four days later, a quick acquisition of Wayco Manufacturing to diversify into hair care products was completed.[/TO DELETE] Datapulse said the S$3.5 million buy, which didn't involve shareholders' approval, was part of a diversification plan, lest the company be deemed a cash company and face the risk of trading suspension.</Para><Para>Ms Intan Ng has had to serve two requisition notices for an extraordinary general meeting to address a proposed change of board, and the company's diversification plan. It has been set for April 20.</Para></TailParas><Byline fid="by" index="field">Stephanie Luo , Datapulse board questions suitability of Ng Bie Tjin as proposed new director </Byline><Credit fid="cr" index="field"></Credit><Contact fid="ct" index="field"></Contact><Notes fid="rf" index="field"></Notes><Art fid="art" index="field"></Art><Copyright fid="cy" index="field">(c) 2018 Singapore Press Holdings Limited </Copyright></Article></ArchiveDoc><AdocTOC adoctype="article"><Item size="0" ref="distdoc:archive/ArchiveDoc::Article" type="arttext"></Item><Item size="0" ref="distdoc:archive/InvertText" type="invtext"></Item></AdocTOC></DistDoc>
