One day later, the casino's head of human resources sought her out to deliver an unequivocal message.</Para><Para>"You need to keep your mouth shut," the executive, Arte Nathan, told her, according to Ms. Saxton.</Para></LeadPara></HandL><TailParas fid="td"><Para>Mr. Wynn <ELink type="webpage" ref="https://www.wsj.com/articles/steve-wynn-to-step-down-as-wynn-resorts-ceo-1517972210">resigned as chief executive of Wynn Resorts Ltd.</ELink> after The Wall Street Journal <ELink type="webpage" ref="https://www.wsj.com/articles/dozens-of-people-recount-pattern-of-sexual-misconduct-by-las-vegas-mogul-steve-wynn-1516985953">published an article in January</ELink> documenting allegations against him, and he has since <ELink type="webpage" ref="https://www.wsj.com/articles/steve-wynn-cashes-out-sells-roughly-third-of-his-stake-in-company-he-co-founded-1521727039">sold his entire 12% stake.</ELink> Now regulators are investigating the company he left behind.</Para><Para>Descriptions of the workplace from dozens of former employees paint a consistent picture of life at Wynn properties, and of the managers Mr. Wynn hired and promoted. Complaints were often dismissed or ignored. Supervisors sometimes looked the other way when Mr. Wynn asked for the private company of workers.</Para><Para>Some supervisors advised employees to keep quiet to protect their jobs. Others were instructed to find damaging information on complainants as a pretext for firing them. Mr. Nathan, who handled human resources for many years at Mr. Wynn's properties, declined to comment.</Para><Para>The employees, many of whom are describing their experiences on the record for the first time, outline a wide-ranging corporate failure, from senior management to lower-level employees, who through their action or inaction enabled the boss's behavior.</Para><Para>At times, former employees said, low-level supervisors were sympathetic but felt themselves powerless. Tiffany Kambouris, who was a salon manager at Wynn Resorts, said she brought complaints about Mr. Wynn's behavior toward women to upper management without effect.</Para><Para>"These people are supposed to be handling problems and taking care of it, and they don't," she said. "It's shameful."</Para><Para>The employees' accounts, spanning decades, jobs and different properties in Mr. Wynn's empire, help explain why the casino magnate's alleged behavior might have gone on for so long, with complaints extending back to the early years of a career that made him one of the industry's most powerful men.</Para><Para>Mr. Wynn, when he resigned, said he couldn't be effective in an environment in which "a rush to judgment takes precedence over everything else, including the facts." In a statement for <ELink type="webpage" ref="https://www.wsj.com/articles/dozens-of-people-recount-pattern-of-sexual-misconduct-by-las-vegas-mogul-steve-wynn-1516985953">the Journal's January article</ELink>, which reported Mr. Wynn had paid $7.5 million in 2005 to a manicurist who told others he forced her to have sex, Mr. Wynn said the idea that he ever assaulted a woman was "preposterous." He didn't address other allegations in the article.</Para><Para>Responding on March 15 to questions for this article about misconduct allegations beyond those detailed in January, an attorney for Mr. Wynn sent a statement on his behalf saying he "declined to participate in The Wall Street Journal's reporting because it is clear that the Journal has no intention of treating him fairly." The statement called the allegations "salacious" and didn't address their specifics.</Para><Para>Wynn Resorts referred questions about the allegations to a special committee of its board investigating Mr. Wynn's behavior. That committee said the board "cares deeply about the safety and well-being" of employees, but that it isn't appropriate to comment until the investigation, aided by outside counsel, is complete. New CEO Matt Maddox said in a written statement he and the board will act quickly on any recommendations from the investigation, adding the company has "zero tolerance" of sexual harassment.</Para><Para>Officials in Massachusetts, where Wynn Resorts is building a casino-hotel, have said they <ELink type="webpage" ref="https://www.wsj.com/articles/massachusetts-review-of-wynn-allegations-holds-high-stakes-for-casino-1517400000">are looking into who was told of Mr. Wynn's alleged behavior</ELink> and what, if anything, they did in response. Mr. Maddox recently indicated on CNBC he has known about the manicurist's 2005 allegations since 2016, and court filings indicate general counsel Kim Sinatra has known since at least 2009. Wynn Resorts wouldn't comment because the board investigation is continuing.</Para><Para>A written anti-sexual-harassment policy given to Wynn Resorts employees states in part: "The first and most important thing an employee must do is speak up."</Para><Para>The rules were different when it came to Mr. Wynn, said Jorgen Nielsen, who was artistic director of the Wynn Las Vegas salon when it opened in the mid-2000s.</Para><Para>He said Doreen Whennen, then vice president of hotel operations, made clear any complaint involving Mr. Wynn should be taken not to human resources but to her or to Marc Schorr, then the company's chief operating officer.</Para><Para>Mr. Nielsen said he brought women's complaints to Ms. Whennen on several occasions and she sometimes told him to look in the employees' files to see if there were any past problems that could be a pretext to get rid of them.</Para><Para>"It was always the person's fault," he said. "Nobody really looked into it."</Para><Para>An attorney for Ms. Whennen said she had no comment.</Para><Para>Mr. Nielsen said he sometimes brought complaints about Mr. Wynn's behavior with women to Maurice Wooden, then COO of the Las Vegas operation, and now president of Wynn Resorts' two Las Vegas casinos. One time, according to Mr. Nielsen, Mr. Wooden responded by saying managers needed to better control the female employees who were complaining.</Para><Para>A company spokesman said it would be inappropriate for Mr. Wooden to comment until the investigation is complete.</Para><Para>When complaints were reported to Mr. Schorr, Mr. Nielsen recalled, Mr. Schorr said he would speak to the boss.</Para><Para>Mr. Nielsen said that in follow-up conversations with Mr. Schorrâ€”after nothing had changedâ€”"we would say, 'Have you called him?' He would say, 'I'm working on it. I'm working on it.' I don't know if he ever had the conversations" with Mr. Wynn.</Para><Para>Some former employees said Mr. Schorr wasn't the ideal person to judge workplace behavior. He sometimes made comments about women's breasts and, for years in the 1980s, he gave female assistants lingerie as presents, according to these people. Mr. Schorr didn't respond to requests for comment.</Para><Para>Former salon manager Ms. Kambouris said she told Mr. Schorr that Mr. Wynn's behavior was "out of control." She, too, experienced it, she said: When she gave Mr. Wynn a manicure, he would sometimes rub his leg against hers and "say, 'How does that feel?' " She said she brushed him off as best she could.</Para><Para>Ms. Kambouris said she was dismissed in 2013 after a salon management change, in what human resources told her was Mr. Wynn's decision. Wynn Resorts said it doesn't comment on employment matters.</Para><Para>In the winter of 2010-11, Joan Fernald worked at the Wynn Las Vegas spa when she was assigned to give Mr. Wynn a massage. Once on the massage table, Ms. Fernald said, Mr. Wynn repeatedly indicated she should massage his genitals. She refused. "I was offended that he was insulting me and my professionâ€”that he thought I was somebody who would do that," she said. A similar scene unfolded during several subsequent sessions, she said.</Para><Para>After each event, she said, her two managers at the spa inquired how things had gone, casually asking questions such as "Did it happen again?" Eventually, Ms. Fernald said, she described the incidents to the executive director of spas at the company's Las Vegas casinos and asked what to do.</Para><Para>The director, Ella Kent, was sympathetic but gave no advice, Ms. Fernald said. "Her response was one of skirting around the issue," the former massage therapist said. "The attitude was: 'He is Mr. Wynn. How do you say no to Mr. Wynn?' I think she did not want to be the one to anger him."</Para><Para>Ms. Kent didn't respond to requests for comment about Ms. Fernald.</Para><Para>Wynn Resorts' policy is that all employees receive regular training to prevent sexual harassment. Mr. Wynn said in a deposition he didn't participate because he didn't need it, according to comments made in court by a lawyer for a party involved in a dispute between Mr. Wynn and his ex-wife.</Para><Para>Wynn Resorts told the Journal in January it had a hotline that hadn't recorded a single complaint about Mr. Wynn, a statement <ELink type="webpage" ref="https://www.cnbc.com/video/2018/03/09/wynn-ceo-matt-maddox-wynns-resignation-was-the-right-call.html">CEO Mr. Maddox repeated to CNBC</ELink>. Instructions posted on an employee intranet portal say the company's confidential hotline is for accounting or securities issues, not for harassment complaints. For those, employees are told to go to their supervisors or the human-resources or legal departments.</Para><Para>Asked about that, Wynn Resorts said the line was set up in response to a 2002 federal securities law but has mostly been used for human-resources matters, despite the written instructions saying otherwise. A spokesman said the company would change the language on the site.</Para><Para>Karen Parente, who was hired to work as an art-gallery manager at the Wynn Las Vegas in 2005, said she noticed the deference with which others, including managers, treated Mr. Wynn. "People were scared of the guy. I could see that in their mannerisms. If he even walked past you on the retail floor, I could see the bodies tightening up," she said.</Para><Para>Ms. Parente traveled with Mr. Wynn to pick up a painting at the Getty Center in Los Angeles. On the plane, she said, he guided her into the bathroom and then pressed his body against hers. She said she eased her way out of the bathroom. Another time, she said, he found her in a lounge one night and indicated they should go to a hotel room together, which she declined.</Para><Para>Believing no manager would help her if she complained about Mr. Wynn's actions, Ms. Parente said, she resigned, left Nevada and moved into a different line of work.</Para><Para>"I knew if I raised a stink that I would be blackballed," she said.</Para><Para>Before Mr. Wynn opened the Wynn Las Vegas, he built and ran the Mirage casino, where Ms. Saxton, the spa attendant, started working in 1993. She was exercising in the gym one evening the next year when she said Mr. Wynn came and asked for help working out, which he sometimes needed because of failing eyesight.</Para><Para>He asked her to help him into the hot tub in the men's locker room, according to Ms. Saxton. He took off his clothes and told her to remove hers, she said. She said she didn't want to, but relented when he told her "it will be fine. You can help me."</Para><Para>The spa attendant, 23 at the time, said Mr. Wynn initiated a sex act on her. She said she grabbed her clothes and ran out, shaken.</Para><Para>Later that evening, she said, Mr. Wynn called her at her mother's house, where she livedâ€”she assumes he got the number from employment files or an HR employeeâ€”and said the incident had been a "misunderstanding." Her mother, Pamela Abramowitz, said she got on the line and asked Mr. Wynn not to call her daughter again.</Para><Para>The next day at the spa, Ms. Saxton said, her boss, Nina McLaughlin, pulled her aside and asked her about the incident, making her feel chastised.</Para><Para>She said Ms. McLaughlin didn't advise her to report the incident. "I remember feeling zero support," Ms. Saxton said. "You don't know what you are going to do" in a situation like that. "You are trained that you help him no matter what happens. You drop what you are doing any time and you help him."</Para><Para>Ms. McLaughlin said in an interview she didn't intend to make Ms. Saxton feel as if it was her fault. Ms. McLaughlin, who said she didn't have all the details of what allegedly happened in the spa, said she believes she asked Ms. Saxton whether she wanted to report the matter, but left it up to her.</Para><Para>"It was a frustrating situation," Ms. McLaughlin said. "It did make me sick inside. Here's this young, vulnerable girlâ€¦ Instantly you would be gone if you do anything or say anything."</Para><Para>Ms. Saxton said Mr. Nathan, then the head of human resources, approached her at work and told her the incident was her fault.</Para><Para>"Don't try to make this into anything," she said he warned her.</Para><Para>The executive also approached Ms. Saxton's sister, who worked for him in human resources, and her mother, an employee in convention sales, blaming Ms. Saxton for the incident, her mother and the sister said.</Para><Para>All three women stayed on but said they felt their jobs would be in danger if they pushed the matter.</Para><Para>Reached by phone, Mr. Nathan said he didn't want to talk. He didn't respond to detailed questions sent by email.</Para><Para>Mr. Wynn's Mirage Resorts Inc., which owned the Mirage, <ELink type="webpage" ref="https://www.wsj.com/articles/SB952354247870743159">was sold in 2000</ELink>.</Para><Para>Through the years, some Wynn executives, especially in human resources, have had an almost filial relationship with the boss. Mr. Nathan, who headed human resources at Wynn-managed properties from 1983 to 2006, grew up knowing Mr. Wynn in upstate New York.</Para><Para>"It's like working for my father and uncles. Nothing is left unsaid," Mr. Nathan told the Las Vegas Review-Journal in 2005.</Para><Para>The head of HR for a year shortly after Mr. Nathan's tenure was Peter Early, a financial-services executive who was married to a daughter of Mr. Wynn at the time. Mr. Early didn't respond to requests for comment.</Para><Para>The current HR chief, Troy Mitchum, who is the son of Mr. Wynn's longtime secretary, said in an interview posted online by Wynn Las Vegas in 2015 that he began his career with Mr. Wynn in 1985 in the mailroom and that his father and daughter were also employees. "Working at Wynn Las Vegas, it's like working for a family," he said. Mr. Mitchum referred questions to Wynn Resorts, where a spokesman said it isn't uncommon for employees to be related to others at the company.</Para><Para>In the 1980s, before Mr. Wynn built the Mirage, he renovated and ran the Golden Nugget in downtown Las Vegas. It eventually became part of the Mirage Resorts company Mr. Wynn sold in 2000.</Para><Para>Dora Barnum, who was a young Keno runner at the Golden Nugget in the mid-1980s, recalled Mr. Wynn asking to speak with her about different departments she could work in temporarily while renovations were under way.</Para><Para>He took her to a dark, empty lounge, with his security detail waiting outside, placed her hand on his genitals and pushed her head down, indicating she should perform oral sex, she said.</Para><Para>"I said, 'I'm married. I can't do that!' " Ms. Barnum said.</Para><Para>"He said: 'If you don't want a job, you can leave now,' " she recalled.</Para><Para>She felt threatened, she said. "So I did it. I felt disgusted with him, with myself."</Para><Para>Not long after, Ms. Barnum said, her supervisor told her Mr. Wynn had found her a job in the main cage where gamblers go to cash chips.</Para><Para>She said she told the supervisor, Dick LeVasseur, what Mr. Wynn had done. "He didn't believe me," she said. Mr. LeVasseur said he didn't remember Ms. Barnum but he recalled how the Keno area was being remodeled.</Para><Para>Ms. Barnum said Mr. Wynn continued to make unwanted advances, including calling her home late at night, and she ultimately left her job because of it.</Para><Para>About four years ago, she told her grown daughters Mr. Wynn's repeated nighttime calls had caused arguments with her husband, who is now deceased, according to one daughter, Denisha Barnum.</Para><Para>Ms. Barnum told her daughters if anything similar happened to them at work, they shouldn't hold it in. "Make sure you say something," she said she told them.</Para><Para>Jim Oberman and Lisa Schwartz contributed to this article.</Para><Para>Write to Alexandra Berzon at <ELink type="webpage" ref="mailto:alexandra.berzon@wsj.com">alexandra.berzon@wsj.com</ELink>, Chris Kirkham at <ELink type="webpage" ref="mailto:chris.kirkham@wsj.com">chris.kirkham@wsj.com</ELink>, Elizabeth Bernstein at <ELink type="webpage" ref="mailto:elizabeth.bernstein@wsj.com">elizabeth.bernstein@wsj.com</ELink> and Kate O'Keeffe at <ELink type="webpage" ref="mailto:kathryn.okeeffe@wsj.com">kathryn.okeeffe@wsj.com</ELink></Para><Para>Related</Para><Para>* <ELink type="webpage" ref="https://www.wsj.com/articles/dozens-of-people-recount-pattern-of-sexual-misconduct-by-las-vegas-mogul-steve-wynn-1516985953">Dozens of People Recount Pattern of Sexual Misconduct by Las Vegas Mogul Steve Wynn</ELink></Para><Para>* <ELink type="webpage" ref="https://www.wsj.com/articles/steve-wynn-to-step-down-as-wynn-resorts-ceo-1517972210">Steve Wynn Steps Down as Wynn Resorts CEO</ELink></Para><Para>* <ELink type="webpage" ref="https://www.wsj.com/articles/steve-wynn-cashes-out-sells-roughly-third-of-his-stake-in-company-he-co-founded-1521727039">Steve Wynn Sheds Entire Stake in Casino Giant</ELink></Para></TailParas><Byline fid="by" index="field">By Alexandra Berzon, Chris Kirkham, Elizabeth Bernstein and Kate O'Keeffe </Byline><Credit fid="cr" index="field"></Credit><Contact fid="ct" index="field"></Contact><Notes fid="rf" index="field"></Notes><Art fid="art" index="field"></Art><Copyright fid="cy" index="field">Copyright 2018 Dow Jones &amp; Company, Inc.
